the day started
guys the other day I bought is a kini
from the store I'm gonna put it in my
pants and see how many people I can
prank with this this is like the awkward
prank I'm gonna see how many people
actually like notice and decide to like
point something out but I'm gonna play
it off like super low-key so so cold
let's go troll some people yo are you
ready to go yeah what how much you video
what's out of the nürnberg show what he
doing it's kind of freaking are you bro
I'm feeling I'll lick oh honey I even
notice it's blending with the black
pants is me you know me for a long time
lady do what you said you need a great
sleep and stress alright guys so this is
what today let's go I'm literally
physically aged no tiara maybe Europe
you notice anything different on my
outfit
you notice anything different about my
outfit today no what do you mean do I
look fresh yeah everywhere do you mean
dude I'm confused
what's happy you guys will give to you
up a break he has no idea what's going
on League it's a French thing bro chill
don't worry about it
I'm not hiding who's next
so guys I was gonna troll more people
with this sooo Keaney and then the worst
possible thing that ever could possibly
happen in my life happened last night I
remember like vividly like kind of
falling asleep with my laptop on the bed
and then I remember moving when I was
like half asleep and then the laptop
pretty much fell off the bed and usually
when it falls off the bed it falls and
it lands like on it's on the bottom side
of it which is where all like the
hardware is but it fell off the bed and
landed like this and then I just
remember like being like a half asleep
in a daze and just closing the laptop
not really thinking much about it and
today when I went to upload my vlog like
literally just now I open my laptop and
this is what the screen is looking like
right now I turned it on and it made the
sound like that and then watch this can
you even see the screen you can barely
even see the screen but if you look
closely the screen is completely broken
you cannot see a thing on the screen all
you can see is black right now so my
whole plan game plan everything just
changed for the day I was gonna go to
UCLA cuz the nug boys are filming like a
prank there and I was gonna go help them
out because you guys remember the one
that we did at Carleton where we dropped
at a school fake dropping in a school
prank that was so fun to do so obviously
I wanted to do it again in the States
especially because I've never been to
UCLA that would be dope but now I have
to get this resolved before I do
anything because I need to keep dropping
these vlogs so I think we're just gonna
go get food and then go to the Apple
store hopefully I'm not at the Apple
store all day this is a bit of a
buzzkill
I mean look at those lines oh my god so
painful to look at Oh
Oh - I've got me a monitor we're gonna
check if the computer actually still
work you know HDMI cable so this is what
it looks like
they were monitor here the moment of
truth we're gonna hook it up to the HDMI
and pray that the computer still works
on this bender you know Leslie get your
appointment right now for Deb look I
know I got a book it now please give me
something give me something in the
monitor works we know that nothing is
showing up yet but guys like every
important document I've ever done and
anything like that is all on here and I
don't really think it's backed up so
this could be a buzzkill to my old a
your hard drive is always hard drives
always a mess on this like when you drop
through the hedge that should be good no
okay so as you guys can see this is not
good this means we need to go to the
Apple store immediately my life Apple
Care Alert oh yeah
uberx l-looking I played myself when I
booked my appointment for my MacBook for
like 4 p.m. but basically in like 3 or 4
days so now we have a bunch of time to
kill because I had to find a new
appointment because all the appointments
got filled up so now we were just going
to the mall and I had to get it exact

beautiful day of the mall in the
Galleria doing Galleria things so I
think I finessed an appointment it's
like an hour 45 minute wait problem is
all the guys just left me because they
thought I was gonna have an appointment
in there so now I'm walking in the
Galleria by myself I don't know where
anyone is don't think they're in the
Lego store that is something I don't
think but knowing them I see an Adidas
store I have no idea if they're in there
but I know ryan loves adidas so let's
get it second best guess not Adidas
store
it's Zara we don't fit well we don't
grow they have xxx don't fit in stuff
I'm tired of coming in the store we
don't fit in anything in the store so
it's kind of pointless but I have time
to kill so who knows I might just caught
this when you see his hair Yoshi bricks

president not okay I'll take it back
good raging success on the costume Bank
says he never buys jerseys for the dogs
because you know he doesn't want to
curse the team but I had to do it firm
because I knew it would look nice I
thought it was gonna fit Paris but I
definitely overestimated how big Paris
was Fitz London so it is what it is
let's get it
day two vlog I forgot how dependent I am
on a laptop guys it's ridiculous I was
looking into flights because I wanted to
go home because Sylvia's birthday is

even have a laptop to like book flights
or anything I just got an email though
back from the place that I went to
yesterday Apple store and they said that

mission so if I go there and it's not
ready it's gonna be a buzzkill on my day
and a big waste of time but basically I
