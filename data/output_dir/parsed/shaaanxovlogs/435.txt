Jandal or a sandal how they've got the
bit that goes between your tire and it's
like a scarf and then it's got a cover
like that like a little bridge you put
your foot on there
yeah and that always came off yeah when
you're walking like shh-shh this way it
clogs well no I didn't have clothes I
wanna close my mini screen hair clogs we
used to go to go and swap shoes for the
day because my mum should be a
girlfriend no my mom wouldn't Bobby
clogs could she speak though ugly yeah
well if that shows right go watch Opie's
childhood memory I've got a good one
nothing okay I kind of sit this one out
for myself
back in the day this is a terrible story
by the way back in the day me and about
50 other people because I went to a
country school and we all were like you
know you'd have yeah eights and nines or
whatever what was it at school years
something whatever years those years
probably wrong but you have like two
years maxi diff heaps of people in a
class at a country school and one day
there was a sewage pipe that was broken
on the field there's a sewage pipe on
the field and it was like a concrete
slab and all the grass had been mowed
but what had happened there someone had
come in and shoved it all up so I was
like a hole like that big in someone had
chapped it up so ass being at a country
school where like sweetie it's what can
we do at lunchtime don't know so one of
the guys one of the guys got a bunch of
sticks and put them over the hole so
it's all the time yeah and a sewage pipe
sorry so sticks all across the hole and
then cover it up with fresh --mode guts
and move the cone that was the down to
the side oh this is terrible I don't
know but I thought we did it so these
are things you do as a kid and then um
one about mates it
and he obviously went around the cone
and then steps down into the hole like
one of his legs fell down there and he
said oh I'm going off and I'm telling so
he ran off when and got the teacher who
was like the deputy principal in the end
it turned out to be the deputy principal
came walking out like what's going on
and then by this time we'd already read
covered the whole again we had about 20
of us hiding in the bush she K there was
a lady she came walking out she looked
at where the cone was and picked it up
almost like oh what's going on I don't
even know know what they're talking
about and then she went to walk back in
off the field and she felt like not
completely but one of her legs went
straight down the hole she stood up
hitch hitch one of the guys just started
cracking up and pointing at her and E
right now sprinted away I was like why
would you stand there and point at her
get out of here
so we'll just denied it but everyone got
the teen chatter and we had to write
about like a lyric apology formal leader
were there like name an address at the
top so it was the worst child well
you're like a dead child no I wasn't
them see everyone else I was watching
like everyone got in trouble I was a
real good kid until I hit like high
school I was wearing makeup to school
they gave news attention all the time
before wearing makeup oh that's pretty
badass yeah and a creek uniform because
I used to wear like there's not 90 so
this is off topic
you never use number no this is a better
question what would you watch when you
got home from school
well if it wasn't the 90s what I watched
when I get home from school would be
sticky TV and now I see those people on
the you Channel and it's so awkward
like beyond awkward oh yeah it's like
they don't talk like little kids anymore
that's just felt like only like on the
wither
yeah and they took real serious and he's
white girl on you that pisses me off I
hope he watches it thank you
she's a bit bland oh she's terrible how
did she even get a job and she talks
herself out I could go on free but it's
not important 9s okay when I got home
from school I remember it was spongebob
and then it wasn't honest
their whole spoke old yeah I remember
watching Spongebob and then Digimon was
on I hated it so used to just half-ass
watch it and then do like my homework
because I was good Digimon a winner
after that no because then after that
like a Pokemon or you you were on so it
was okay like I just had to wait that
like 20 minutes for that to be over
because it was did you still like
how they played the songs with Pokemon
like a teen Viridian City poker I didn't
know since dreams change channel not a
tree pokémon fan yeah am i clicked at
the sticker books did you stack of books
yeah like the Pokemon books and then you
collect it like they pick a stick is no
I just played it on Gameboy yeah so did
I but I'd the stick books and I hit that
I had the manual you know like the UM
how did you have time to deal with it
like the game actually took like it was
like the master manual so they put on
the eggs oh my god like activity
books from Pokemon I loved it
Oh in a little Pikachu my auntie it was
like the little worm what are they
called
kind of like collecting basketball cards
you can talk about them like they're fun
you know nice did you actually did you
hear cars oh good what is you you felt
like actually feels like huffy live in a
park
someone's probably gonna claim their
cards and they were probably worth a lot
too because it was a lot better yeah
good steel you don't feel bad if you
pick up like a twenty dollar note but if
you found a wallet with someone's name
in it end in my name is yellow yeah but
if you find something and is like
nothing to link to it you're like
it

when I was when your kid is like a
million dollars I know you could give
some okay I remember this did you when
