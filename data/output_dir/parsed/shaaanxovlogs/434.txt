hey everyone they've run sorry sad again
hey it's alright okay do your thing say
your little line hey everyone so today
we're doing it to christian arts this
video we're doing one obviously you can
see it on this channel here and there's
also going to be one over on Hamish this
channel so yeah not many of you probably
know that it has a channel but I'll link
it down below and you can check it out
and subscribe if you like what you see
so I asked on Facebook for everyone to
ask questions and we have like a couple
hundred here so I'm just going to skip
through a few and decide which ones to
answer andrea asked Hamish when you and
scheana meet what was it like knowing
she did YouTube and what was it like
when you moved in together did you find
it a bit odd oh oh I gotta watch what I
say here mate I like now when I first
meet Shannon she you were they bug on
your sugar no no you were a little bit
but not like now no she wasn't they're
big we just used to I didn't really know
about it to be honest at first like I
knew she liked makeup and I knew she he
knew I did it it was just like okay it's
a bit weird
ya know I didn't think I was weird I
just thought it was cool for you if you
like doing it whatever just never seen
it before that's all but yeah it wasn't
that big and I don't think you're doing
it as much with you yeah it was like not
my full-time thing yeah it's just like a
like side will be so it was kind of just
like whatever and then obviously down
the line it got more and more popular
and then I saw how well she was doing
and that she liked doing it so I thought
I was really really good like it wasn't
hot at all yeah yeah I think it's a
weird that I just started talking myself
knows no not because I've tried to do it
as well like I've said in this room and
trying to record something and they're
very sad and I know how awkward it is
yeah it's like like it's really awkward
because she has something else did you
find it odd when we moved in together
not why would I find it odd um I like
with YouTube and stuff oh okay yeah
that's not on she just does it well I
make work whatever okay Hayley Winona
has some tips for high school and NCE
in CIA's a joke it's so easy like cyber
achieves so long like I was I was in the
no Chico I was a excellent girl I wasn't
a cheap guy but if you just want to pass
and you don't really care about getting
amazing grace like honestly
all you have to do is I literally do the
classwork like you you'll have enough
knowledge to be up to pass easily they
may that's what you have to do mo but
NCO doesn't like the excellences and
stuff like that I don't see how they
ever met it it doesn't really at least
you go for a job right after high school
yeah it doesn't matter in scholarships
yeah if you don't need scholarships but
I just there's like ten questions and
the test for NCA and I think I got three
achieves on one mirror because that's
what you needed to get I know it sounds
lazy but I passed and I went to
university and pass University so comes
down to her like uni so different to its
size it's nothing like that's all you
have to do the work so so long as you're
committed and you want to do the work
you'll be fine and if you really want to
be out to make sure that your paths take
subjects we were allowed to do open book
tests like I remember food nutrition I
took food nutrition you're allowing it
was actually hard like I dunno one of
them but you you were allowed to have
your books open and like you could just
copy all the answers straight over but
like really like how does anyone fail it
yeah I yeah I know no I didn't fail one
but I am I've done exams all the way
through my uni life and then in my last
year I had open book test and I didn't
know I was an open book until like the
more I took the bucket and I hadn't like
made notes of the important points so I
sit through the whole time like trying
to get everything a hundred percent
correct and like reading all the answers
out the book I'm putting them in so it
was it can be bad but chance obviously
used to it Hey hmm yeah venture uncle
SHM alkyl it was your man crush no no no
no no no we're not answering that would
you rather eat a peanut butter and
salami sandwich or a jam and gook and
sandwich jam and gouken for me cuz I
hate peanut butter
well again peanut butter and more peanut
butter and salami you know basically
right ahead yeah
oh and I'd home gym and gook and even
though that sounds foul
I like gherkins I like jam but together
