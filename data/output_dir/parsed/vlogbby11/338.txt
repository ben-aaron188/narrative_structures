good morning I mean coffee realize how
much I'm not a morning person I kind of
am because I love waking up early my
ideal day would to be to be a morning
person wake up like 6:00 a.m. like today
what kind of like eight takes me forever
to actually wake up even if I wake up at
like 12 I don't wake up like wide awake
I wake up like you know super uber then
I take that back sometimes I wake up and
I'm like on top of the world who I have
low world at 7:00 a.m. and I don't know
let's get coffee oh my gosh yes oh my
gosh Panera coffee with a star how is
that I was explaining to them that I'm
not a morning person like sometimes I
guess it's better to teach me forever to
wake up okay we are home and I'm about
to start getting ready because today is
a very big filming day and you know
should probably do my hair and put some
makeup on don't have to you been Oh dan
dan dan dance down't down't down't
down't down't and and and next here
hello room getting up the makeup I do it
at my desk again today
well make this done very exciting and
now we are going to work on the mess of
the hair that is my hair I'm just gonna
curl it all so I tried out a new brow
product i normally use the anastasia
dipbrow i love this i love it so so so
much if you guys know Jacqueline I'm
obsessed with her for like the longest
time
Jacqueline Hill has been recommending
the brow definer the new one from
Anastasia dasya or Anastasia however you
just however you say it the triangle one
so it's a lot thicker and I'm not even
getting it so easy to apply normally I
spend a good amount of time on at my
eyebrows just because like with like the
dip brow you can be really precise so I
could easily spend like five minutes
total putting on I'm filling in my
eyebrows but with this it's literally so
so quick so if you have school or work
or anything where you have to get ready
really fast in the morning I definitely
recommend this it's so much better than
the brow is I did to get a lighter color
because they were out of the medium
brown so I got the soft brown honestly
looks really good it's really natural
and I am obsessed with it figured I
would share the obsession and you guys
should go get it if you're looking for
new eyebrow pencil and I like it and
hair is finally done it looks so much
better I haven't actually curled my hair
and the longest time uncle is really
good actually like doing my hair okay
guys so one decimated a is Nikki and
Gaby's birthday oh my god happy birthday
it's currently 11:48 a.m. which means in
pennsylvania´s three hours ahead says
almost three o'clock couple days ago I
ordered them some birthday presents to
get there on their birthday but I wanted
to surprise them like not say anything I
have to address because I was just there
the problem is they haven't text me yet
I don't know if it's there and it says
it was delivered some little confused I
don't know if they just haven't like
gone outside and seen it part of me is
worried like what if for some reason I
got like the address wrong what if it
didn't get to like their actual house
and I paid extra so we can get there on
their actual birthday like I thought
that'd be really cool No
I don't know kind of like patiently
waiting for a text to come and literally
like any minute it should give you text
like any minute my situation right now I
should be home soon we're going to film
all all all day probably should clean up

there yeah so I'll keep you guys updated
but okay so I forgot to tell you guys I
recently got some more like fairy lights
and then these little like photo clips
from Urban Outfitters so I just put
those up and it was really easy which
was which was awesome as you guys can
see um but right now I'm gonna try to
find some Polaroid so I can hang them

little shorter like I said but I think
you're gonna like it on this night when
I like edit all the footage that we get

any ideas what it is I will say there
are some bikinis involved but that's not

on my main channel I recently hit a
million subscribers and now we have on
my second channel I never thought people
would care about my day-to-day life that
much like that many people think ass hey
guys what's up so um I'm still in a
great mood have an exciting announcement
that I'm going to announce I want to do
something different to say thank you for
a million vlog babies on this channel I
am going to do my very very first you
know aka live stream going to be a huge
party it will not grow I mean it'd be
cute if we actually decorated it like a
party but let's be real probably I'm
gonna be gonna be cute I might go all
out we'll see you're going to be next
Thursday okay all the information is
gonna be in the description box and I'm
gonna talk about it and probably every
vlog up until then next Thursday which
is May 12th probably like the evening
I'm gonna like still figure out the
exact date and time and put it here on
the screen and in the description box
yeah I've never done a live stream by
myself I've done the last one I did I
think was like two or three years ago
Sierra or Mia I've really been wanting
to do one for the longest time and um um
and yeah so I figured that was like a
perfect way out it's like a live stream
basically it's like a live video feed of
me talking and then you guys can comment
and it's just like a live vlog you know
so I thought it'd be really cool I'm
excited I'm really excited oh my gosh
I am so hungry you guys don't even know
doctor usual I know Mediterranean salad
with an app hole what'd you get Oh like
what Alicia's usual open I got the soup
because I'm actually the dozen good we
think she is a cold hey we're sitting
with this great beautiful window so the
Lighting's like deep set which is nice
it's normally immediately dirty and
veneering little things that youtubers
appreciate you know MS Gerald is a
update time as you saw we went to a
coffee shop let's see it is now 951 p.m.
literally my favorite coffee shop like
ever only downfall is I swear they're
only like two or three outlets in the
entire store and it being right next to
a college and really popular it's a very
unlikely to get an outlet and obviously
like with editing like my battery goes
down so fast oh my gosh and you guys I
got a brulee latte so so good obviously
this was like a splurge it would not
have this like every single day and they
put sugar on top and then they torch the
top so it's like like creme brulee but
like just not creme brûlée but latte
version oh my gosh is so good usually
don't drink all of my lattes but I
actually drink that entire thing and it
was so good I don't regret it yeah
anyways we're back home and I'm going to
edit a little more of my main channel
video and then I think I'm going to edit
this vlog so I can get it up in the
morning for you guys or I'll wake up
early and edit it but I probably should
edit it tonight yeah
