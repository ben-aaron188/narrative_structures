(upbeat instrumental music)
-  Those pilots
right there are wavin' to you.
-  Can you wave back?
Say, "I did it!"
-  I did it.
-  Yay!
(laughing)
(screaming and laughing)
- Is Calvin gonna come to the airport?
- He is, as soon as that
little stinker wakes up.
Good morning guys.
We are getting ready to go.
Jared, you just gotta brush your teeth.
-  I'm brushin' my teeth.
- Zip that up, we're good to go.
So, I'm just getting my shoes on.
And even though these are
really high, they're actually
very comfortable.
And I thought this was very interesting,
because yesterday, Jared was
saying like, "Brownie points
"to this spouse, or the significant other
"that notices a change
in the other person."
And Jackson looked at my
toenails this morning and goes,
"Why are they red?
"Where's your blue toenails?"
Like he loved the blue toenails.
And he talked about my blue
toenails for a long time.
And I think it's so funny that he noticed.
You are so sweet.
(jazzy instrumental music)
I spy an older couple
staring at their phone.
- Hello.
-  Who is it?
Who could it be?
- Hello!
(Ellie laughing)
-  Get off your phone!
(jazzy instrumental music)
Are you gonna Instagram Grandpa's picture?
He's pretty brave to put
that in front of you.
No!
You guys, fly safe.
Isn't this funny?
We have run into mom and dad
a few times at the airport
(laughing) while they're on their way.
- One of these days, we're
gonna go to the same place.
- We are goin' to Disney Land!
(laughing)
- Mom and dad are going to Germany!
- They're doin' like
a whole European trip.
- What fun.
- Yep.
We're goin' to see Jennifer's
brother who's over there.
- Yes, my Uncle Todd's over there
doin' a service mission.
- Are you goin'
to go to Disney Land?
(laughing)
- Someday.
Someday we're gonna go
to Disney Land.
- Should we take
Grandma and Grandpa to
Disney Land sometime?
- You take me with you.
(jazzy instrumental music)
-  Those pilots,
right there, are wavin' to you.
Can you wave back?
-  One more time.
-  One more time, wave to 'em.
- Look!
- They're wavin'!
-  Hey Jackson, if
you wanna fly the plane,
now's your chance to ask.
Do you wanna go fly the plane?
-  No.
(laughing)
- Okay.
- You changed
your mind?
(jazzy instrumental music)
-  Do you see that Ellie?
Do you see that?
- Hi!
- It has our name on there.
- Yay!
- That's never
happened before.
-  You're our guide today!
How are you?
-  Look, there's our name Jackson.
Is that cool?
- Yeah.
- Okay guys, I think that
there is a fine line,
and I never want, ever, to
come across as complaining.
But I also wanna come across
and tell you how awful
(laughing) that flight was.
- We are lucky to have
great kids, aren't we?
- Oh, our kids are the best.
- We really, really are.
But this was different (laughs).
- To be honest, we've just
gotten done with a lot
of traveling, too.
I just wanted to tell you guys that that,
'cause every flight, like,
"Our kids were so good,
"our kids were so good."
But I just wanted to let
you know that they're not
always so good.
And it wasn't crazy,
they're just so tired.
Calvin is so done.
So, we're in the car.
We're meeting Brian and Missy
- Woo!
halfway, I can't wait
to go eat some dinner.
We're all starvin'.
And get some play in.
-  Calvin is adamant
to hold both of our hands,
so I put his crackers in
his mouth so he could hold
both our hands (laughing).
(upbeat instrumental music)
- What a better way to
get off of an airplane
and run free in this cute play area.
We are at some sort of Be
play area, and the kids
are just running free.
And you can run and
touch anything you want,
play.
This is so cute.
So you didn't wanna sit on
an airplane, but you wanna
sit on this?
What, what, what?
Hello!
Are you comin'?
(laughing)
I think he liked it, but his face!
(laughing)
(upbeat instrumental music)
Go down together.
-  Whee!
- Woo!
Okay, Missy told me to go down this one
'cause it's really steep.
(yells)
(laughing)
- Look how (laughing) hesitant he is.
-  You can overcome fear.
You can do it.
You're so hesitant.
-  Go for it!
-  You can do it!
-  Yay!
-  Say, "I did it!"
- I did it.
-  Yay!
- Okay, so for us bein' in
California and in this huge mall,
I feel like we have the
whole mall to ourselves.
- Yeah (laughs).
- This is amazing.
Come on boys.
I wanna go together.
Is that Finn?
Is that Finn?
- Say, "Hi Finn."
Can you say hi?
-  Hi.
-  Hi.
(laughing and yelling)
There the boys are.
You guys are running too fast!
(upbeat instrumental music)
Want help up?
Can you make it up more?
You use this, babies.
Here ya go, ya baby.
Climb up.
Climb up.
You made it.
Cuties, let's go!
(upbeat instrumental music)
Ready?
Woo!
-  Yeah.
(yells and laughs)
- Did you see his face?
Going with the two babies was not smart,
but they liked it.
Don't tell Missy I almost
threw Finn half down the slide.
(upbeat instrumental music)
- This obviously is like
one of the best places
for kids and for us.
Like, I am having just as
much fun as the kids are.
- Very enjoyable.
- Brian, stop shooting me!
(upbeat instrumental music)
Okay Jackson, hit the button.
(air whooshes)
Whoa!
Was that so cool?
This is absolutely hilarious.
There is a noticeable difference in smell
walking right over here (laughing).
I think 90% of it is because of Jackson
and Calvin's shoes.
Whoo!
-  Okay, Jer-Bear.
- Code word is whiskey.
-  Whoever throws
up gets to choose dinner.
(yells)
- Whoa!
Whiskey,
whiskey!
(laughing)
-  That's the secret word, whiskey.
-  Your turn.
(upbeat instrumental music)
How many of you babies can we get sick?
- Whoa!
- Whoa, look how happy--
(laughing)
-  He's like, I'm out.
-  I'm outta here.
-  It's like a
washing machine for toddlers.
-  Okay, Jackson
has requested to go faster.
Hold on tight.
- Ready?
- One,
two (laughs),
three.
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Was that fun?
- How was it?
- Come on.
- You liked it?
- He might be out of it.
-  Hey, did you like it?
He's too busy.
He loved it.
- He's not even in the same place.
- Just a mild concussion.
(Ellie laughing)
- Okay, round two.
Brian musta done somethin' right.
-  There ya go.
-  Say, "I'm
gonna sleep good tonight.
"I'm gonna sleep good tonight."
-  'Cause you could
gift that and make it go
forever.
- Yeah.
-  Someone gift that
and make it go forever.
(upbeat instrumental music)
-  Oh no.
Oh, get 'em better.
You don't look so hot.
Gotta get him taken care of.
Oh, ooh, did that hurt?
Ooh!
That's double shots!
- He's a tough puppy.
He'll be alright,
- Aw.
- he'll make it.
- Aw, yeah,
I would squeal too.
Is he gonna be okay?
- Yeah.
- Oh, feeyoumfth, you'll be okay.
(squeals quietly)
You just gotta get food in you.
And in me,
- Mm hmm.
- 'cause I'm starvin'!
- I know a lot of Ellies.
I know happy Ellie, I know sad Ellie.
I know crazy Ellie, but
the worst Ellie of all
is hangry Ellie.
- Hangry.
I told my mom and dad in the
airport today, I was like,
"Mom, do you have lots of snacks?"
And she's like, "Oh yeah."
I said, "'Cause you don't
want anyone hangry."
- Yeah.
- And I looked at dad.
(laughs)
That's where I get it from.
- Dad is a hangry person too, isn't he?
- Yeah.
- I think everyone has
a hangry side.
Missy, can you attest to that?
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.
- Who's more hangry?
You or Brian?
- Um, me.
Wouldn't you say I'm more hangry?
When I get hungry, I'm like--
- Um, yeah.
(upbeat instrumental music)
(camera shutter clicks)
(camera shutter clicks)
(camera shutter clicks)
(upbeat instrumental music)
-  I mean, who doesn't
want a bath at Lush, right?
This is the best place to have a bath.
♫ I love Lush
- Every time I walk in,
I'm like, "We love Lush."
And everyone's like--
I gotta tell 'em how much I love 'em.
-  What color's this one, Jackson?
- Green.
-  Green, yeah.
Does it smell good?
- It smells stinky.
-  (laughing)
That's the best stinky
I've ever smelled before.
(tapping)
- This is why we said we'll
eat outside (giggles).
Jackson is using his chopsticks.
Good job bud.
More like just stabbing it,
but you're gettin' there.
That's awesome.
Can you try it?
Calvin's been waitin' to try this.
Whoa!
-  Bro, look it,
you got like three
grains of rice on there.
-  You're gonna
be so hungry tonight.
No, I'll just grab it with my hand.
That's what I do too.
If you guys ever come to PF
Chang's, I usually do not like
honey dew, that's what it is?
I'm so confused.
- These little melons.
Yeah.
(laughing)
- But it's so good and refreshing.
You have to get this dish if
you ever go to PF Chang's.
You lost your strawberry.
-  Now you gotta eat it, dude.
-  All in ketchup.
Are you gonna eat it or no?
- Yes.
- Well?
Okay.
Yummy!
- It was short, but it was sweet.
-  It was good to see you.
- Gotta say goodbye to our friends now.
Seriously, I feel like
we jam packed that visit
and don't you guys?
- They're gonna sleep so good!
-  I know!
Look at these guys.
(laughing)
My ride home is gonna go so smooth.
(laughing)
- You too?
-  You boys, look at this.
Oh my gosh.
Good job, Calvin.
We gotta go down.
Okay.
I will wrangle the kids
and then we'll say goodbye.
-  Bye.
-  Bye.
Aw, that's so sweet.
- Bye.
-  Oh,
too cute.
-  Calvin, do you love me?
(moans)
Do you love me?
(grunts)
-  I love you, Jackson.
-  I love you too.
-  Thanks bud.
- Why are they treating us
- What is goin' on?
- so good?
- Are you kidding me?
Get out!
Ellie (laughing), look at that.
-  It has a guitar.
-  Oh my gosh, are you kidding me?
-  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-  Look at these guys.
- Yeah, yeah.
-  Oh my gosh.
The Mecham Family.
Look at that, Ellie.
- This is, I'm speechless.
-  I am too.
- Jackson and Calvin?
-  No way, it
has their names in that?
I can't believe they
have Dr. Pepper there.
I'm gonna have to drink some.
You know that, right?
- Look at this whole loft, oh my gosh!
This is creepy.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh!
- Oh, ho ho!
Don't look down.
-  We far up.
-  We are far up.
- That is,
- That's fruit.
fruit, look, strawberries.
- Wow.
- Oh, strawberries,
and cantaloupe.
-  Do you want to eat a strawberry?
- And honey dew.
Oh my gosh, thank you.
You know who you are.
Thank you so much.
This seriously just made our night.
Holy crap.
- "For the little ones to wear
"to the event, if they like."
Uh yes!
-  I love that!
(Ellie squeals and laughs)
- That's gonna be so cute!
-  Okay, now
that the lights are on,
oh my gosh.
This is just,
this just, oh my gosh.
This is so wonderful.
- Jackson, this was
so nice of them to do, 'cause
this is really for you guys.
-  Yeah.
- I'm very excited to go
to the event tomorrow,
and I've never been in like,
a hotel quite like this.
(laughs)
- This is pretty incredible.
- Wow.
Well, babies, good night.
Good night.
- I have had such a fun
day and I am so zonked.
-  So fun seein' Brian and Missy.
- Oh, we love those guys.
♫ Duh duh duh

scary in your Care Bear onesie.
♫ Dah
