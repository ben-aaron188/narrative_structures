the gym know what my sister brung my
sister and I was like okay literally
can't do it like I can't work on three
hours sleep and it wasn't a normal
workout I started doing Crossfit
sessions like once a week kind of thing

high-energy consistent working out is so
tiring
I'm knackered you having a good time
look at your little head anyways I'm
going to get up now
Zoe and I woke up earlier to listen to
Adele on Radio one with Nick Grimshaw
she is literally hilarious I feel like
she's just going to take over the world

speakers so loud downstairs right I need
to get out a voice of room we changed
the pin let with the sheets last night
and I've already ruined it with all my
face or my makeup so if I look all gray

person in this office in some ways in
some ways I love it I think I've always
been somebody that loves my own space
like don't get me wrong I love hanging
out with friends and family and I love
and I'm very very sociable but at the
same time I do love my own space like I
love being able to just go off by myself
and just I'd
no what's YouTube videos edit videos but
those are too few sheep like I don't
know I don't even know I like just
having peace and quiet and that doesn't
mean that I don't like hanging out other
people I don't I don't know if some of
you the same as me I just really like
having my own space on my own sometimes
I just feel very content being by myself
like I like it and today is one of those
days because it means that I'm more
productive and I'm not getting
distracted by things and I'm getting all
my all my work done I really really want
to show you this merchandise that I've
