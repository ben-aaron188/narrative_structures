I don't know I'm doing this last time I
tried to balance everything in my hand a
smash my iPhone today I probably got
like 8000 pounds left four cameras
balanced on one arm in the exact spot
that I smash my iPhone two days ago

that but I'm putting the camera away
we managed to get everything into the
office without dropping any cameras

microphone stuff over here I've got some
microphone stands that arrived this
morning I'm absolutely loving to go to

cameras to test out different camera
