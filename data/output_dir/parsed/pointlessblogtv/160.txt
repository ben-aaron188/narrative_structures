so 3:00 a.m. this morning an alarm
started going off in our house and woke
everybody up we were awake for like an
hour and 15 minutes 3:00 a.m. so the
last thing I felt like doing this
morning was go for a run let's do some
laps on the garden to wake us all up
come on Sean when you do two laps and
the garden come on need to wake us out
get this get this run get the run in
you're meant to be doing it as well come
on come on come on one more lap I don't
think that's the fastest running Zoe
yes we're meant to be up at 6:00 running
what are you doing he's done the two
laps you ripped now Sean yeah from that
run close were planting going you have
to reach it them watered is it
watercress no it's like water babbling
water off it you can't start the day
without a morning backflip
all right let's go we're all good we're
ready it's time for breakfast today
we're switching things up a bit
papi and I you know how competitive we
are we literally turn anything into a
challenge you do would you know we're
doing Bobby's can turn this into a
challenge of who turns it into a
challenge so Kellogg's going Dutch and
they have asked us to use the hashtag
because the arm and see who can make the
most delicious bowl of cereal
I mean poppy has a food blog a website I
mean not I've read it or anything that
would probably help and I don't even say
this you have not made it that this cute
this is okay not it's not you think it
is basically Special K original crunchy
nut Coco Pops cornflakes Rice Krispies
bran flakes milk cranberries apple
banana yogurt Kiwi
I don't know I'm doing this you know
what these are blackberries blueberries
honey strawberries raspberries we've got
these got bowls these are nice aren't
they
I see oh that would help with next spoon
how are we going to do this we don't
want at a time a little spoon how are we
going to do this well whatever wait no
now probably gets so excited let's do it
eat your hair do you want to take turns
doing this I don't even so you make your
mother from say a beastie affair I
should do my fur for saying that you do
yourself I'm going to go out the rhythm
for five I mean the gardener member
leave the camera view you make a bowl of
cereal and then get that and then I'll
come back in to make mine now I'm poppy
she's probably going to make some like
fancy like a blueberry inside a
strawberry in place on top it's not all
about the aesthetics it's about what it
tastes like you know got to have a
delicious breakfast in the morning to
get you up get you energized get you
back to put on the trampoline and that's
kind of like pop is first cooking
YouTube video or bees or any moment you
think
mine's getting better national Watts
make it at the same time no I see and
that is what your Savior gonna work
better together know who don't work as a
team it's 19 top is called him back in
because she thinks it's going to be
better if we make the food at the same
time I wouldn't see what you're doing
because you're that competitive you
can't even make a bowl of cereal without
me hard right I'm going to start making
mine then you can pop it let me see what
pop is doing and then I can take her you
catch at six oh that is right that is
what we call well you're making using
some piece of art that doesn't make it
taste any better just remember that
remember that one will taste your mind
open heart
you never so normal here it always -
extremely yeah but are you doing yoga or
are you gonna milk yeah stage one
complete we've got the cereal there
half-and-half in mind
I meant the decorating if you're also a
double cereal person like me I'm
actually honest I've never actually had
I've never had two shows at once or are
playing a risky card here cornflakes and
Special K new you have it all with its
night trying to happiness 5050 but we're
not doing like a level I mean we're dog
in breakfast what's the time 909 is
already late well maybe having breakfast
right 7:30 look how cute this little
milk jug is mixer row okay I'm going in
like a baby I'm gonna have some of these
as well I love the difference now yes I
guess because I like blueberries I like
blueberries but you can't eat my cereal
that might look so good
if I look so good that you're trying to
eat it why are you get spacing them out
why are you judging my breakfast you're
swapping out you're trying too hard you
know you are this is a weight economy
there we go look at out that looks so
cute
nothing I've got and then mine is done a
drizzle of honey I'm so happy with life
very well maybe their breakfast just
standing up I eat my breakfast on the
sofa no no it's gonna have some vine how
we rating these I think pure taste
I don't think aesthetics comes into it I
think a bit in 50 oh by noticing oh yeah
no it's nice it tastes nicer who doesn't
we know it doesn't act guys not that do
not listen to that fact
okay si for our choices right obviously
you're going to say yours is good it's
going to be good of course it looks at
this is how it is yours does look very
good it's also going to taste some rich
but it's not going to certicates mine
here we go
no question I'll get a little bit of
everything don't lie as well you've got
to actually say I like the crunch of the
bunching that I like is a fruit the only
thing I don't know how keen them on is
you're going to say smell yeah I'm
always milk always milk
so I'll probably rate that solid three I
joke it no being serious
I would eat that for breakfast that
tastes really good however if you switch
the yoga out with milk I think it would
be nine out of ten maybe even the pain
that's my favorite fruit as well you're
just missing Madonna
remember they eat it up remember you
need just stop although it is breakfast
time we've spent so long we've spent so
long making these that were like when
you have to enjoy in a second just
remember the minds got the duo blend the
double lid open glow dry heart Special K
half cornflakes banana blueberry drizzle
of honey mm-hmm
you ready open your mouth now I know you
have to get a bit of everything on there
that's important okay I'm a suburbanite
yeah the milk of cereal ratio is good
that's good right
banana no it is that that banana is
going to give you the energy to get this
battle on the rumbling it to wake up in
the morning I wish you could try some
what you didn't make mine a chair oh
I'll get that a seven are you sick yes
that's all you hated yeah yeah
