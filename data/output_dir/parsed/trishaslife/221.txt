we've flown that's traffic oh my gosh
ooh it literally is taking me like 20
hundred minutes to go one block this is
la um I got my guilty shirt on this
position of this camera is always so
weird to me I am so tired you guys Oh
mom no gross the zits on my chin oh my
gosh guys I'm so so tired I like what to
bed like at a decent hour last night I'm
just like so tired but anyways I just
woke up this morning I should put my
things
I was Jared at the Hamilton soundtrack
really I was like I am NOT giving away
my shot I am NOT giving away my shot yo
just like what country I'm young stop
being hungry and I'm not giving away my
shot like I heard it's how to get
tickets I don't even know I haven't even
looked into it but I want to go back to
New York and see it because um I love
lin-manuel Miranda I love in the heights
um oh my gosh this like traffic it's
crazy crazy crazy um and so I guess
anyways I'm just a huge tree another
sound drive I guess or listen to the
soundtrack and which I recommend to can
I choose even if you haven't seen the
show cuz the songs are so good they're
so catchy
um and what kind of like reignited it
was him hosting SNL for me don't look
literally in two lanes um with him
hosting SNL for me and like he opens the
monologue with the Sawyer from Hamilton
the most which is the one I was just
seeing like I'm not throwing I'm not
throwing away my shot
my god people are so crazy they
literally just like running through um
but I love that one I love Alexander
Hamilton I love all of it but he did
this like parody of it on SNL he's like
yo my name's lin-manuel I'm hosting SNL
and I'm not throwing away my that is
this like really fucking catchy but
anyways I've been Jamie on that and also
the disaster the musical soundtrack was
a Broadway show that was on for like
four months
earlier in the year and again I didn't
see that one but I seen a lot of clips
of it online and I just was like oh hi
Shirley
I really wish I would have seen it um
and something rotten you guys I'm sure
as pie already announced I didn't have
this comes up from about a week behind
editing my blogs and posting or posting
like I'm editing and fridge final I'm
just like a mess with this wall channel
right now but I'm only about a week
behind okay maybe I'll be catching up
quicker I don't know I start posting
more but uh probably having see just
like the new announcements nothing
matters like oh my god like it says it's
like a big announcement but something
brought in will Chase is leaving ways it
will chase you out will chase is leaving
the role William Shakespeare literal
Michael Jackson this girl has like a the
Michael Jackson mask and the gloves on
home goes like weird she's like really
scared of germs but the same time she
doesn't window don't like me roll your
window up that here's care of germs but
um yeah so anyways like flapping but
where was the point of law that there
was a point is where there was a point
was I just felt
that like so distracted me speaking of
distractions corey feldman on the day
show I was watching this morning that
like what what that guy is so weird he
actually sent me an Instagram about
veganism I guess one of his angels flirt
like I don't know if the book their
girlfriends I don't know like he calls
them his angels I guess I'm like his
girlfriend's I don't know it's like oh
she told me about you want to be vegan
honestly was it kind of a sweet message
I don't know it's something about Corey
Feldman creeps me out I don't know my
sister was like hit on him hit on by him
when she was like I mean she was like
she was like 17 I mean of course people
I didn't know that but like my sister
does look a lot older than she is she
always has like you won't she's like 15
people while she was like literally 21
um but so it is always a good creepy
vibe for whatever reason then I watch
them on The Today Show today I was like
what is this like so the American flag
on the fucking ground I'll like okay
crazy um so yeah and I don't have no
clue where I was going with anything I
was just saying
we were talking about Friday oh my god
something rotten oh my god Trish guys
Adam Pascal is Pascal help us go Murray
not to Adam Pascal Adam Pascal from rent
the original Y my very kind of name oh
my god the original rot quietly the
original Roger from fucking rent is
playing at fucking William Shakespeare
on something Ron and I thought when
Christian Burrell was in the role and he
was so fucking good I never saw will
chase by him I'm not a big cool treats
man by the way if that's his name I
can't think I can't remember I think is
his name he was on um smash he was JFK
on smash it was like not a fan and he's
on national i'm like not a fan i just
not a fan of him you know there's
certain people you just don't like you
know you don't like spark what like just
like I don't really get this person
that's slick well whatever but I'm sure
he didn't even fuck about what I think
about that but I'm just saying like Adam
Pascal I'm making sure I just wanted to
say something like a fucking love him
like everything he's done I like loved
him obviously when I'm such a redhead
that I'm just like okay like he's got
right because if you're obsessed with a
Bryant you were obsessed with obviously
Pascal like obviously like him and
Daphne Rubin Vegas but her name is
Arnold you don't really know the rooms
but like I just love them because
they're like iconic like iconic right so
anyways what are we even talking about
so he's gonna be William Shakespeare
which i think is an amazing role
something Ron something Bryan is closing
in January so I feel like I have some
stake in this for some whatever reason I
don't know why I'm not getting paid I'm
not in the show but um if you are in New
York go see something Ron that's like my
favorite favorite show right now
in New York and I was a Hamilton but
like I kind of don't remember it which
fucking sucks like I remember it but
like not the way normally member shows
like I can recite you like word-for-word
shows like something wrong I could
recite you word-for-word all the songs
like I love it well power as a great
song hard to be the bard which is good
he's gonna fucking kill a he's gonna
fuckin kill it I mean Christian world is
like iconic Shakespeare to me but like I
think I would be really hooked me good I
was really excited when I heard that so
I don't know if I got like inside news
or like no one's just talking about
explain no one is a fuck
