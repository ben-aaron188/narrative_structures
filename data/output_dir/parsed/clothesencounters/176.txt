so I am starting with a clean and
moisturize face as always I'm still
using tartes Amazonian clay and so I'm
just gonna dab it all along my face and
even do like a little Simba smear on the
forehead to really distribute the
product and then using a little buffing
brush I'm just going to really blend
that in and now I'm going to go in with
concealer and I am using Maybelline's
instant age rewind this is another Holy
Grail product of mine and I'm going to
just apply this on the dark circles and
around my nose and I guess under the
chin too now going back with the buffing
brush I'm just going to blend this all
in now that we're finished with that I'm
just gonna set everything with a powder
I'm using a Charlotte Tilbury zaire
brush flawless finish I just got this on
a whim at Nordstrom because I heard some
good things about it and I can't tell if
I like it more than my Rimmel stay matte
which is a fraction of the price I'm
just using this one today because I paid
good money for it so I'm just going to
use it up so I'm just gonna Pat it all
across my face and this is just gonna
seal and lock everything in so now it's
time for the brows I am going to use
tarts emphasize for brows so I just drew
a line at the base of the brow where I
want it to begin and then I'm just going
to use this bully and just going to try
and blend it and there's still product
left on this bully from the hundreds of
other times I've used this while doing
my brows and so that products just gonna
rub up on top okay that looks pretty
decent I'm gonna go in with a darker eye
pencil and this is Urban Decay's brow
beater in the shade dark and I just
thought I would give this a go because I
was only using on estancia's brow Wiz
for the longest time and then I just
realized why am I so committed to this
brand so I thought I would branch out
and try a different eye brows stuff and
they seem to be doing the same thing
maybe my skills are improving yeah I'm
just gonna draw the ends of my brows
with this dark color
so I always like the tales to be the
darkest part of the brow okay now I'm
going to use the spoolie a good old
spoolie I'm just going to blend it in
okay I give up
this is what my brows look like today I
think they're fine now we're moving on
to the eye shadow I'm gonna get this eye
shadow stick color in the shade amethyst
this is by Laura Mercier and this is
just kind of like a purpley brown color
I'm just gonna put as the base because
shadows just stick on and are more
pigmented when you do this I've been
getting a lot of questions about how I
fixed this eye to be a double eyelid uh
I just used double eyelid tape you can
get it at any like Korean beauty store
even any Asian beauty store I put it on
every night before I went to bed and I
would even wear eye in the day sometimes
I did that for a good month and a half
and it eventually started to crease and
now it's like this I mean it's still a
little uneven but it doesn't really
matter it's fine I mean it's a big
improvement from what it used to be so
no I didn't get eyelid surgery I just
used eyelid tape so now that we've
applied this base I'm just gonna go
ahead and work on some eye shadows and
I'm using lorac pros mega - palette and
as you can see there's a ton of
different colors on here but I'm just
going to use a few today I'm going to go
in with goji and this is kind of like a
peachy mauve color and I'm going to get
a little shader brush I suppose and I'm
just going to Pat that on my eyes okay
now that that's finished I'm going to
get a fluffier brush like this one and
I'm going to go into a Cabernet which is
like a deep plum color and we use this
to intensify the edges I'm just gonna
kind of smoke it out the best I can
without ruining it I think it needs a
little bit more blending so I'm gonna go
in with another eyeshadow palette I'm
sorry I don't kill me but I'm gonna go
with with my trusty lorac Pro palette
and I'm gonna go in to mauve which is
just like a
st rose color and this is going to be
the perfect shade to really really blend
everything out
I feel like this blending brush has
saved my ass so many times because I
just feel like if I make any mistake
I'll just go in with this brush it'll
make it look better yeah it's totally
made a difference nice now I'm just
gonna get a black eye shadow and I'm
just going to use kind of like a denser
brush and I'm going to apply this on the
inner thirds or the outer thirds of my
eye just to give the look a little bit
more drama now to brighten up the eyes
I'm gonna get this kind of pearly shade
and I'm gonna apply it in the inner
corners of my eyes just to make my eyes
a little bit wider if I do this with
every makeup look I just feel like it
perks up my eyes cool now I'm going to
pop the same color onto my brow bone and
I feel like this just kind of erases any
mistakes that you've made with blending
and just ties in the whole look together
it makes it look more polished and when
the Sun hits it looks awesome now that
the eye shadow is done I'm gonna go
ahead and with an eyeliner and this is
Kat Von D's tattoo liner and this is
recommended by Claire and since using
this I can't find a liner that's better
than it so I'm just gonna give myself a
little cat eye and so now I'm gonna go
back in to the black eye shadow and I'm
just gonna give myself a little bit more
dimension I like to put the black eye
shadow after I do the eyeliner too
because then I can really see where
everything starts and I feel like it
just fades in better yeah this looks
good if you'd like you're more than
welcome to leave the eyeshadow look like
this but I think I want a little bit
more color so I'm gonna go in with my
Urban Decay vice 2 palette I'm going to
get the shade betrayal and I'm gonna pop
that onto my lids just to give it some
extra dimension see so you can see the
difference you could either choose this
eye or this one
now I'm happy with eyeshadow and so now
I'm going to get started with my lashes
I'm gonna give my lashes a little pump
with my schumer eyelash curler and then
once that's done I'm going to go in with
Lancome's seals booster and this is just
a primer for the lashes just to lengthen
and make my short lashes look a little
bit longer before I cope my bottom
lashes I'm going to line the lower lash
and I'm using miss Hanna's eyeliner in
the color Brown tightlining always feels
so weird okay now that that's finished
we can add the seals booster to the
bottom lashes so as we're waiting for
the primer to dry clear I'm just gonna
go ahead and start contouring so I'm
gonna zoom out for contouring i'm just
using Tilbury
film-star bronze & Glow so I'm just
gonna apply this to the hollows of my
cheek and the good thing about you know
messing up about contours you could just
cover it with your hair and it looks
fine I'm gonna go ahead with blush I'm
using tarts exposed and I use this blush
every single day
and I've yet to hit pan not even close
now that we're finished with the blush
I'm going to go and start highlighting
and normally I would just use the higher
that comes with this bronzer but I am
experimenting with a new highlighter and
it is Becca's shimmering skin perfecter
and this Tyler is so pigmented it just
makes your cheeks pop and so I'm just
going to apply this to the highest
points of my cheek it looks like the
primer is completely dry so now I'm
going to go in with a mascara I'm using
Lancome's Hypnose doll eyes and this is
the waterproof formula and I'm just
going to apply it to the bottom lashes
first
I feel like wearing false eyelashes
today and I'm using our gels demi
wispies and I've spoken about these in a
favorites before so you know how much I
love these and I'm just going to apply
it all over the band now comes the
tricky part
alright we're going to apply this to the
lash now I'm going to shut up
I'm going to move on to the last and
final step which is the lips and I
haven't decided which lip product I'm
happy with so I'm just gonna use them
both the first one I'm going to show you
is from bite and it is in the shade
leche I think that this is the perfect
peachy pink nude shade for any statement
I I think it looks really great but if
this is a little bit too safe I'm going
to try a more daring color and this one
is color pops trap and this is the ultra
matte lip and I think that this is a
little bit more of a dusty darker rose
color so that is the finished makeup
look and I've been loving to rock it
especially on nights out because so
eye-catching
and I hope you guys enjoyed this makeup
tutorial I know I don't film them that
often but I'm going to try and change
that for this year my goal is to try and
film a tutorial every two months
I think that's doable for me if you
