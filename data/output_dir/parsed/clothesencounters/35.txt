(calm music)
- Hi, guys!
It is Monday.
Welcome to the first day of
the September Part Two vlog.
It's 5:42 p.m. and things
have finally calmed down
but I've just had so much work to do.
I turned in my rough cut for
my 24 hours in New York video
and then I filmed this fall makeup look
which I am rocking right now.
I love it.
I just feel like it really
goes well with the bangs.
This fall makeup look is due tomorrow
so I'm gonna spend pretty
much the entire evening
editing this guy.
Also I got metal straws finally!
You guys proud of me?
It's something I've been wanting
to get for the longest time
because I like drinking out of straws
because I don't want to stain my teeth
and I drink a lot of coffee, a lot of tea,
so the straw really helps.
But anyway, I'm gonna
continue to chug along
and I'll talk to you guys in a bit.
So I'm just taking a
little break from editing
and I wanted to show you
guys the gifts that I got
at the housewarming party Ben and I threw
on last week, I think?
Yeah.
And everyone like brought
gifts and it was so nice.
I like really wasn't expecting it.
We had never seen our house that full.
There was over 50 people in our house
and it was cool going to like
every story of our place,
seeing everybody get along and hanging out
and just having a good time.
And I just wanted to
showcase the gifts that I got
because they were just so thoughtful.
The first item is this.
This is a picture frame that
my friend Jonathan gave me.
I think this is my 25th birthday
and these are all my high school friends.
I've known Brianne
since I was five though.
Or six?
I met her in the first grade
and we're still friends today.
But it's so cute, I love it.
The second gift I have is this Palo Santo.
I believe this is kind of like sage
and you're supposed to like light it up
and you're supposed to,
I don't know, get rid
of any demons or bad juju in the house?
Palo Santo literally means holy wood.
Shamans and healers traditionally burn it
for its energetic purification
and healing attributes
much like sage.
Bingo.
This is from Teresa.
She couldn't physically
be here but Voo made sure
to give this to us.
So thanks, Teresa!
This next gift is from Sophia.
She got us this beautiful chip bowl.
Me and Ben are always hosting parties
so this is gonna be great
to, you know, put the chips
and then put the guac in here.
This is gorgeous.
Looks like a hat.
Okay, and then she also
got Ben this apron.
Ben's always cooking and splattering stuff
so this is gonna be perfect
for him when he cooks.
It also looks like a
really cute dress (laughs).
Now for Stephanie's gift.
She got us this beautiful aloe vera plant.
Unfortunately this is the
only pot we have to fit it
and I feel like it's gonna
outgrow this pot pretty soon
but it looks awesome.
If we ever get sunburn or...
Yeah, if we ever get
sunburned, we can chop it off
and put the aloe vera all over the wound.
So this is awesome.
And it just looks like a work of art.
It kind of looks like something
from Beetlejuice, huh?
The next gift is from Waylee and Wa.
They got me this beautiful diffuser.
I'm gonna open it actually.
I'm so excited.
I love things that just make
the house smell nice, you know?
They got me this beautiful diffuser.
They got me this soy candle,
it's called Dawn Cube.
Thank you guys!
I might as well just feature
all the other candles
but this is a candle that
Emily got me and Ben.
This one is for Ben actually
because she chose the more
masculine scent for him.
This one is vanilla husk and sandalwood
and it definitely smells,
it just smells like a man
but a good man.
This next candle I do
not know who got for me
because it didn't have a card.
But this is a Kush candle,
so there's cannibis in here.
But (coughs).
Doesn't smell like it at all.
It just smells more like tulip
actually, tulip and amber.
Next up, I have these
coasters from Jolene.
Thank you so much.
These are just beautiful marble coasters
in this one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.
Octagon shape, and I've got four of them
so this is gonna be great
for saving my countertops.
Then from Andrea, she gave me
this gorgeous orchid plant.
It's holding up pretty
well, I'm very surprised.
And my battery's about to
die so let me go change that.
I believe this is also from Andrea
but I haven't opened it yet.
Oh, okay, oops, I forgot to
show you guys the packaging.
She taped a little
sprig of lavender on it.
Oh, nice!
Okay.
And she got me this huge torpedo of sage.
But yeah, I believe you're
supposed to burn this
and it's supposed to
purify the space as well.
Thank you, Andrea!
Alright, so this gift
is from Aaron and Jamie
and I believe it's one of his prints.
So excited to see this.
Wow.
Whoa, cool!
Oh my god, this is so freaking sick.
I love Aaron Kai's work.
It's very colorful,
psychedelic, and shroomy.
Can't wait to hang this up somewhere.
This is so beautiful.
Thank you so much, you guys.
And I also have one last gift.
This is from Rebecca.
We already framed it on the wall
but it is a photo that she
took at our engagement party
and it is amazing.
It finally replaced the Flying Lotus flyer
that I've had since college.
So this is a lot more sentimental.
So thank you so much, Becca!
And then we also got a ton of alcohol
so we're pretty much
stashed for, you know,
probably end of the year (laughs).
So Ben went grocery shopping today
and he brought back something
that we normally don't have
in the cabinet.
He got a wild card item
which are Everything Bagels.
And I haven't had a bagel, well,
I haven't had bagels in the
house since I was like a kid.
Actually like got too
excited and I ate half of it
while it was still cold.
For tonight's menu, Ben
is making shrimp tacos!
- Very excited about this.
Usually we do it with tilapia fish.
Shrimp today.
We got some guac, we got
some yogurts and sriracha.
Cabbage and cilantro.
- And a glass of white wine.
How many avocados did
you use for the guac?
- One.
- Wow.
Bang for your buck, huh?
- Bang for your buck.
(mumbles) like the yogurt but let's see.
We got so many sauces so
there's some sriracha here.
I put it in the sauce as well.
- I'm pretty sure this
is the perfect amount.
This is the finished shrimp taco.
(laughs)
(mumbles)
(calm music)
Okay.
(audio fast-forwarding)
Hi, Cheeki.
Oh my god.
Look what just came in the mail.
This is from Ashley and Vanan.
And this is the biggest bouquet
of flowers I've ever seen
in my entire life.
Jesus.
It's so big!
So on top, there's a giant bouquet
and underneath there's
like this water tank
with orchids inside and
then there's rocks and sand.
And this is from my favorite
flower shop, The Empty Vase.
It's Wednesday.
I'm doing the exact same
thing as I did yesterday.
Working.
And yesterday Ben and I filmed
our Google Assistant video.
I tried to vlog but that whole
video is a vlog in itself
so that's why there's just a gap.
Today I am just finishing
up the last touches.
I am feeling good though
because I am checking off
everything off my list.
There's nothing more satisfying
than checking boxes off.
I haven't been to the gym in a little bit
so I'm kind of feeling
a little cabin fevery.
Later on, I'm gonna go
get dinner with my family
for my early birthday dinner.
We're gonna have Korean food.
What a shock!
Honestly, my mom genuinely
doesn't like any other food
besides Korean and that
just mind boggles me.
She doesn't even like pizza.
She likes spaghetti and steak.
I took her to Boiling Point one time,
which is like my favorite hot pot place.
I was watching her eat the soup
and it was just so underwhelming for her.
And it's just freaking bizarre, man.
I think it's because when she was a kid,
she really didn't have anything
other than Korean food.
But the thing is, even food
that I didn't eat growing up,
I still like.
For example, I didn't have Indian food
until I was maybe 18.
I didn't have dim sum until I was 19
and you know, that's obviously
one of my favorite foods.
So I don't know.
Maybe it's like a preference thing.
What do you guys think?
Is your favorite food
something that you grew up with
or is it something that you
just had later on in your life?
Alright, a little update.
It is 2:00.
I am going to the gym.
It is the last thing I want to do.
But I haven't been to
the gym in like five days
and my brain could really
use some endorphins.
And I know I really don't want to go
but I know after I'm gonna feel amazing
and I'm gonna wash my hair
and I'm gonna have fresh hair for today.
So let's go.
I'm gonna bring this
little vlogging camera.
Okay, I'm off.
(calm music)
(water running)
Yeah.
(sighs) I feel like a new woman.
Oh my gosh, this is literally
the best feeling ever,
how you feel after you take a shower.
I'm just gonna get a wide tooth comb
and I'm just gonna start brushing
my hair out a little bit.
Just so it's not too tangled.
Then I'm just gonna get It's
a 10 Miracle Leave In product.
And I'm just gonna spray this all over.
I just like this because it
doesn't get all over my hands
and it's just super easy to use.
I'm just gonna show you guys
what I do with my bangs.
They're already so long.
Don't kill me, Anna.
My bangs are still a mystery to style.
I'm just gonna let that calm down.
The best drink in the world, La Croix.
Oh my god, it's so good.
I just got this new Charlotte
Tilbury eye shadow palette
and it is gorgeous!
It kind of just looks like--
Okay, thank god.
I didn't want to dig my
nail into the shadows
like I did with the
Fenty Beauty highlighter.
I didn't.
They even categorized the
different eye shadow looks
that you can do, so this
one is day eye, dusk eye,
date eye, and disco eye.
I don't know what is
calling my name though.
I think I'm just gonna hop
around and see what happens.

We got a side of green beans.
And there's my love.

go away for the weekend.
So lovely day.
(calm music)
(laughs)
♫ Happy birthday to you
(cheering)
- Okay, so this present is from (mumbles).
- Cheeki got this one for Mummy.
- Oh, you wrapped it so well, Cheeki.
- Well done.
(mumbles) the tape.
(gasps)
It's another Chippo.

Oh my god!
She loves her.
-  Chippo, right for the neck.
Right for the neck.
(laughs)

Happy birthday.

I've got Grem in the back, Ben driving,
and then Chippo!
I'm dropping her off at my parents' house
because they're watching
her for the weekend
while we're gone, and I'm so excited!
- The weekend officially starts now.
-  Woohoo!
♫ In-N-Out
♫ That's what our hamburger's all about
-  Sponsored by In-N-Out.
I wish.
- Cheers, guys.
Cheers.
Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday!
- So much food.
Two of these in like a week.
- Dude, In-N-Out is always a
must when you drive out of LA.
- Pretty much every time we leave LA.
- Always.
- When you go in and out
of LA, go to In-N-Out.
(calm music)
- Alright, we made it to the
cabin, we're in Big Bear!
And obviously this is even
better than the photos.
It has such a nice rustic cabin vibe.
It's crazy that this is
only two hours away from LA.
It's insane.
But I'm so excited!
Let me show you around
before everybody gets here.
This is the kitchen area,
lots of seating options for people.
Let's head outside.
What do we got here?
- I made it in my very first try.
-  Really?
- Yeah, I was like "Oh, shit!"
Nobody saw that.
-  Get it.
-  Aww.
Aww.
- And then the creepy...
-  Oh, shed?
That's Stephanie's room.
(laughs) Just kidding.
What's in it?
- I didn't even walk in.
-  I bet it's floaties.
(growls)
(shrieks)
- Oh god!
Oh my god.
- So everyone finally made it.
- Cheers, everybody.
(cheering)
♫ Get your hands up, get your hands up
♫ Get your hands up
♫ Put your hands up, put your hands up
(cheering)
(laughs)
♫ Happy birthday to you
♫ Happy birthday dear Jenn
♫ Happy birthday to you
♫ Blow it out, blow it out
♫ Blow it out, blow away
♫ Blow it out
(cheering)
(calm music)
(cheering)
♫ It's your birthday, it's your birthday
♫ It's your birthday, it's your birthday
- We're on the Castle Rock hike right now.
It said it was intermediate to extreme
and this is...
-  Straight, straight uphill.
- Yeah, straight up.
-  Nothing but up.
(calm music)
- Ah, the fresh air.
Yes.
- Feels good out here.
Yeah, it's really nice.
- So we just finished our hike.
We climbed on so many rocks today.
- Yeah.
- Good job, good job, good job.
Hi, everybody!
It is Wednesday.
It has been several days since
I last picked up the camera.
I came back from Big
Bear, I guess on Sunday,
and I had such an incredible time there.
I didn't vlog too much.
I think some people got
like bits and pieces
but I wasn't doing like my normal vlogging
because I just wanted to go
over there, unplug, unwind,
and just be with the
closest people in my life.
When I came back from the mountain,
I was just, I don't know about you guys,
but after like a big, big fun trip,
when you come home you're
just kind of like (sighs).
Like you're just sad that it's all over.
So I think I was just
kind of decompressing
and just coming to terms that it's over.
I was looking forward to
this trip this entire month.
But yeah, that was one of
the best birthdays of my life
and it was nice.
It was very intimate and it
was nice to just get away
from the city.
Today, Ben and I are heading to the beach.
I just wanted to have
like a really chill day
because I feel like the past year,
I have been constantly on the go.
And so I just kind of wanted
something fun and relaxing
and serene.
I haven't been to an LA
beach this entire summer
so I thought that, I don't know,
might as well squeeze it in
during this month before it gets too cold.
We are taking Cheeki and it's
gonna be really exciting.
I just cut up some Korean pears
and I'm just gonna get ready.
(calm music)
We are at the dog beach.
- Rosie's Dog Beach in Long Beach.
-  (laughs) Rosie's
Dog Beach in Long Beach.
- It's our first time here.
It's really nice.
We wanted to have a nice
date day, go to the beach,
and this is the closest one to us
that dogs are allowed.
(calm music)
(waves splashing)
- Brought this book to the beach.
It's called Death Note.
Hey, everybody.
This is as recent as you'll see me.
I'm about to add this clip
in and then export the video.
So I just wanted to pop in
and thank you guys so much
for watching.
I hope you guys have a
wonderful rest of your Sunday
and I'll see you guys
in the comments section.
Bye!
(kisses)
(calm music)
