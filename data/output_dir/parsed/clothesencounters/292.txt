everyone it's me Jen right now I'm in
New York filming a little
something-something at Teen Vogue should
be out later but for now I need to
squeeze in some time to go over June
favorites because June's officially tons
oh I can't believe it's July so let me
show you everything that I loved last
month I'm gonna start with lipstick I've
been loving Mac's shy girl it was in my
make tutorial where I show you how to do
my smoky eye it's been great to balance
out all the heavy smoky eye looks I've
been doing lately like today for example
I'm wearing shy girl right now to
balance this you know top heaviness
going on next up I've got a C's
chinchilla it's been my go-to nail
varnish last month it's this great taupe
ish lavender that looks really amazing
with any color combination I really love
the way it looks with cool toned jewelry
like my helter-skelter rings and these
earrings that I got at a shop admission
I honestly don't remember the name of
the street but it's your 16th and
mission and album that I've been playing
non-stop on Spotify has been Helen by
Jaguar ma they're a dynamic duo from
Down Under
aka Australia and their album always
puts me in just a really fun and sassy
mood something that I always play what
I'm getting ready or just driving down
the car
it is really danceable because it has
lots of sense and it's a little bit an
old electronic side but it's not to
house your techno e because it has a
psychedelic edge to it the song that got
me hooked is called uncertainty I'll put
the link in description box and you can
listen and enjoy the music if you don't
like it then I'm sorry please don't hate
me my good friend Steven recommended
that I read Martian Chronicles by sci-fi
God
Ray Bradbury the Martian Chronicles is
kind of like a series of entries or
short stories of expeditions to Mars and
the colonization of Mars when I took a
picture of it on Instagram as a sneak
peak of my June favorites a lot of
people were commenting saying that they
read that book as a kid or in 10th grade
or something but I don't think this book
is reserved for children I mean
obviously teens and kids can read it but
I think as an adult you can take so much
more out of it Bradbury really keeps you
on your toes through vivid imagery
and philosophical topics that are really
gonna tickle ur brain if you read the
book then I don't know I want to hug you
because this has been one of my favorite
books to read if you ever want to know
how I stab my Instagram photos it's
through this little sucker right here
it's a phone case that has three
different lenses attached and you just
flip through each lens to capture a
moment the way you want it to this
wide-angle lens allows you to take in
more of the shot without having to step
backward the macro lens takes really
great detail shots because it has a
magnifying effect to it and my personal
favorite has been fisheye lens because
it takes so much of the scenery making
it the ideal lens to use for landscapes
a bunch of my favorite scenic Instagram
pictures like this one and this one have
been through the fisheye lens on this
phone case and so I'm not taking like my
DSLR and then transferring into my
iPhone I just don't have time for that
someone's getting pulled over I wanted
to step up your Instagram game that I
think you should consider it it's
definitely an investment and a splurge
but I think it's gonna be able to really
capture your photos the way you want it
to this is SK to Salou mination de Serge
UV I got this bottle when I went to the
SK Chu conference in Singapore if you
wanted to know what my trip was like
then you can watch my Gendo Singapore
video and see all the shenanigans I've
got involved in that country I had so
much fun it's got SPF in it so it's been
great to protect my skin from the
harshness of the Sun and since I'm in my
20s it's been really critical of me to
kind of preserve my skin from aging so
the best way to do that is prevention
and honestly the Sun is such a killer to
your skin it's one of the most damaging
and things that are going to age your
skin so I think an SPF is
super-important I don't think I've ever
featured a food on my favorites video
but that changes today this drink has
been my absolute jam the last month I've
had several bottles of these because
they've been really great to have for
breakfast or even lunch if I'm on the go
if you have a sweet tooth and I think
this is a really good balance between
health and satisfying that craving
because it's not too bad in sugar it
only has 4 grams since it has two
servings in it
and it's packed probiotics and it has a
lot of fiber because the chia seeds okay
so those are all my Jean favorites I
hope you enjoyed if you would like to
make me extra happy you'll give this
video a thumbs up and if you want leave
me a comment tell me the most used emoji
that you use anyway you're the best and
I'll see you in my next video ah
