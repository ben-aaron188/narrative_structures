hi I'm back because it is the beginning
of the month which means it's time for
another episode of favorites
I feel like March always catches me off
guard because February ends so abruptly
and the whole bleep year thing threw me
off too but anyway I'm going to talk
about some of my favorite items of
February so let's dive right in I'm
gonna start off with coats first because
I found this absolute gem at Zara look
at it take it all in this is the perfect
black duster and it came to me at the
Grove in Zara and I've been looking for
a coat like this for the longest time
because this jacket is the definition of
a shape-shifter in the sense that it
goes with everything in my closet so
let's say I am wearing a graphic tee and
boyfriend jeans check looks good let's
say I'm wearing a frilly dainty dress
looks awesome check Ben actually got the
same coat as me as well but in a size
extra large so yes we have the same coat
and we have to ask each other before we
go out if one of us is wearing this
because I mean I guess it wouldn't be
the end of the world if we were matching
but so I used up another top of my clean
at zero which is a cleansing balm that I
spoken about in a ton of other previous
videos but anyway as I was waiting for
my new one to ship I decided to try out
Garnier's micellar cleansing water I
have been hearing so much about this in
the YouTube space that I just decided to
pick it up at CVS
this is basically like Bioderma but a
lot cheaper in the price range you just
shake it up and then you apply it onto a
cotton round and it just removes all
your makeup and for waterproof mascara
you have to leave the cotton pad on a
little bit longer but in the end it will
remove everything on the bottle it says
that you don't need to rinse off with
water it says that you could just use
this but personally I always like to
double cleanse I have to rinse off with
water and then go in with my normal
facial cleanser and then I'll use that
to get that really squeaky clean feeling
and then I can apply all my essences and
serums and everything like that that's
just what I like to do for my skincare
routine but yeah I thought I would do a
little shout out on this because it is a
lot of bang for your buck it's like a
little drugstore warrior it's all
next up I'm gonna blab about some of my
favorite pieces of jewelry at the moment
I have been loving these chokers from
childhood wilds and they're gorgeous on
their own but when you combine them BAM
it looks even more striking and even
more sick so the first one is just kind
of like a barred Elizabethan era
inspired choker the clasp is adjustable
so you can make it as tight or as loose
as you'd like and the second one is kind
of like a spiky teardrop shape and so
when I am combining these together I
like to put the barred one on first so
this one would go right here I like to
make sure that it's really tight well
not to the point that it's like choking
me but I like to make it quite snug and
then I'll use this one to layer for the
bottom and I love investing in pieces of
jewelry because it just like transforms
an outfit like accessories like suck to
invest in but they really really do make
the outfit a candle that I can't get
enough of is dip teks bays and do be
fair I got my first BAE's candle last
year but in February I just jumped the
gun and I got myself a fresh one because
there's just no other candle that smells
and looks like this first off the
exterior is gorgeous it's like a little
accent piece in the room it's got a
black exterior and black wax and it
smells so divine it's like a fusion of
roses and blackcurrant and I know a lot
of other girls that are a huge fan of
the scent as well I know my best friend
Stephanie loves the smell I got this
candle for her birthday last year and
she burned it pretty fast because she
was burning it literally every hour of
the day and I know Sammy
aka beauty crush has like a huge tub
version of this candle that she got for
Christmas and I'm very tempted to get
that one myself one day but this one
will have to do for now I'm not gonna
lie this is like an exorbitant amount to
spend on a candle but whatever I get so
much happiness out of it when I come
into my home and it smells like BAE's I
just feel calm I feel happy and that's
enough of a reason for me to get it
another scent that has been making waves
in my
has been Korres is shower gel in the
scent jasmine and I think this smells
amazing but I am a little bit biased
because I just naturally love the smell
of jasmine I just got this on a whim at
Sephora because I have really enjoyed
Korres body butters in the past so I
thought why not their gels and yeah I do
not regret it I find myself looking
forward to showering because I get to
use this it lathers up really nicely and
I just fills the entire bathroom I'm
nearly out of it I got this late
December so it does last for a while and
I definitely will be repurchasing this
for my book favorite I have Extremely
Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan
Safran Foer and this book has been on my
to read list for the longest time it has
been recommended by friends it's been
recommended by you guys especially in
the comments section whenever asked for
book recommendations this book comes up
at least like five times in the comment
section I was originally reading high
fidelity by Nick Nick Hornby but I just
like got distracted I stopped reading it
and I abandoned it I may go back to it
if it's worth it but yeah I basically
picked up this book instead and I do not
regret it because it's been a really
long time since I've read a book this
moving before this book is about a
little boy named Oscar and he's very
quirky very intelligent and it took me a
while to get used to his train of
thought but after you just kind of like
plow through a couple of chapters just
get used to it and he like really grew
on me and he loses his father through
the 9/11 attacks and it just kind of
follows his journey on how he copes with
such a traumatic loss and the book picks
up when he finds this key this
mysterious key in his dad's room and he
is just desperate to find the lock to it
and so that leads him to meet a lot of
other people and and you get to read a
lot of other stories about these lives
and it shows you how people grieve it's
so crazy to think that 9/11 happened 15
years ago like even saying that out loud
just like gives me chills that's
freaking insane anyway I highly
recommend this book
apparently it's a movie but I don't have
any plans to watch that I'm happy enough
for the book alright folks I'm gonna

to upload a haul video first but i just
wanted to get the favorites out first
