hey guys it's your girl Jen and today I
am filming a mukbang and for those who
don't know what that is it's basically
an eating show where the host eats a
large amount of food while interacting
with our audience and it is a huge trend
Korea so I thought I'd show love to my
roots and film this for you guys or I
guess my own version of it so let's get
started with the first question
castaway hood asks if you're only
allowed one food and one drink for the
rest of your life
what would you choose I am definitely
gonna have to choose soup as my entire
food category because soup is really one
of my favorite foods it's my favorite
thing to make is my favorite thing to
eat when I'm sad it's also really easy
to make you just chop up the vegetables
and you add water and you let it boil
for my drink I'm just gonna have to
stick with water because I couldn't
imagine just drinking soda or juice for
the rest of my life second question
comes from junkie SD they ask if you
could immediately master any language in
the world what would it be and why it's
very obvious but I would definitely
choose Korean because even though I'm
100% Korean I was born and raised in
America which means that my English took
off but my Korean kind of took a
backseat it's just a little frustrating
when I speak with my parents sometimes
because we speak in konglish so that's a
mix between Korean and English if I
could fully master Korean to get to know
my parents even at that deeper level
that would make me so happy
I know I could just learn now but
honestly I feel like it's not the same
as learning when you're a kid my second
language
I'm gonna have to go with Spanish kind
of random I know but like in my hometown
a lot of people who spoke Spanish and I
took like all the Spanish classes in
high school and for some reason nothing
has really absorbed and I know I think
it just sounds really tight
the third question comes from Victoria
xmm she asks any advice for a community
college student who is in the middle of
transferring oh man Community College
was pretty tough for me as well I would
say it
kind of a dark time in my life like I
definitely wasn't super stoked that I
was going I felt very small half of my
peers were going to prestigious
universities going to New York going to
art school all that jazz well I was
stuck in my hometown but now that I look
back it was exactly what I needed I feel
like the positives of going to a
community college is that you can do
stuff at a slower pace I feel like when
you graduate and you go directly into a
college I feel like a lot of people can
get carried away but because I was at
home for two years I was able to just
kind of really hone in on what I wanted
to do who I was and that was the time
when Sara and I started the YouTube
channel and I feel like if I didn't go
to Community College this channel
wouldn't have even happened also the
student debt was cut in half I didn't
have to do a four-year university
student loan going to university in
America is not cheap and the fact that I
get to live
student debt free is amazing I was able
to pay everything off make sure you go
to your counselor I know appointments
can be backed up but you just got to go
even if you just try and make like a
standing appointment stand by
appointment one of those just make sure
you see them make a plan schedule out so
you can get the exact amount of credits
know how you can transfer out always
stick with a plan you got this
Dionne podge asks how did your life
change after cheeki well first off we
wake up at 6:30 a.m. every single day
right on the dot before we were waking
up at 7:30 but that was because cheeki
was just barking and then our trainer
advised us to wake up earlier than her
and then feed her and then go back to
sleep so that way she doesn't get in the
habit of just like parking in the
morning and waking us up because
eventually it would be nice to like wake
up at 8:30 again that's all that it's
been amazing I feel like having cheeki
is like the first taste of parenthood
it's crazy I feel like we're finding
more excuses to stay in we're having
more excuses for people to come over
it's so nice to come home and have
someone be so excited to see you that's
always nice question number five comes
from Tongji he 88 how do you get out of
a slump when everything is not going
right around you honestly getting out of
a slump is pretty difficult for me too
I'm not
perfect I have my bad days sometimes my
bad weeks but I think the first step is
to recognize that you are in this mental
state and that everything is going to
sound like when you're feeling like this
and understand that this is a mood and I
mean for most people moods come in waves
and sometimes just gotta wait it out
you gotta do stuff that makes you feel
better for me when I'm feeling like this
I get very anxious and I feel like I
have so much to do and so what I like to
do is I write in my planner I have a
daily planner that I write in every
single day because I need to get it out
of my system
I've noticed that when I write what's in
my head on to like a concrete piece of
paper I feel like there's like a weight
that's been lifted and that's what's
been working for me so far I mean I
still get into slumps now and then but I
deal with a lot better there's nothing
worse than you being a slob and then
you're not productive and then you get
sad that you're behind and that makes
you an even in a worse mood so the one
thing that you can always do is to stay
plan also if planning is not your thing
and you're just really in a good
difficult state I find that listening to
podcasts really help there is a program
called radio lab and there's just so
many stories on there and it really
opens the doors to all these perceptions
and you hear of others other people's
lives and you realize that you're not so
alone that everyone's kind of dealing
with their own and trying to make it
work all in all just know that everyone
gets into slumps but it's about what you
can do to make yourself feel better hmm
was your family always supportive about
your growing success and YouTube fame or
did it make them quite uncomfortable
when I first started my channel they
were just happy that I was like going to
school this is just something I do on
the side I wasn't like mom dad I'm gonna
geek you for time and dropping out of
school it was never like that at all so
I think they were just happy that I was
doing something creative and they're
happy that I made me happy yeah I was
really always lucky in the sense that my
family was always super supportive when
I was living in Oakland and Davis they
were always the ones that would like
text me and call me about my video and
that was the way they kind of kept up
with me because
LA and Oakland are obviously very far
and sometimes I wouldn't upload in a
week that would be like Toya can tunnel
and the same goes for my big brother
James he's always been so supportive
about what I do he sometimes makes the
music for my videos so go follow him
it's oh my move and any input he has on
my video or my channel I always like to
take because I respect what he has to
say
oh my god this lasagna though question
number seven comes from iced coffee if
you weren't doing YouTube right now what
would your occupation be I think I would
have to say like a project manager or
something like that I would say I'm
pretty damn organized I'm good with
people and I like to get done so I guess
that's what I would do I don't know I
like a start-up or maybe like a fashion
company like I have no idea or maybe a
creative director finding ideas for
photoshoots video content styling
something like that that would be
awesome but I definitely want to stay
youtuber laurdiy asks what does cheeky
want to be for Halloween first off hi
Lauren we try to get cheeky this like
cute ladybug costume it was the only
costume that fit her in the store but
she freaking hates it like her body just
completely melts when she gets in she's
just trying to like wiggle it off so I
think we're gonna try and find her a
different costume something that she
likes and we both like but until then
she'll just a ladybug Kayla trips
question 9 comes from a hoy myth what
motivates you to work out also was it
hard working out the start I have
trouble trying to stay consistent I mean
I don't have the highest metabolism in
the world so it takes a lot for me to
even just stay at this frame so that in
itself is a motivator for me to work out
because I want to eat the way I want to
and still be the same frame also I work
from home so I mean it's pretty much a
sedentary lifestyle if I don't work out
so I have to get out and you know get
blood pumpin all that goodness I've
noticed that if I don't work out in a
couple of days my mood starts to dip so
working out just helps bring out those
natural endorphins and keeps my mind and
body healthy when I first started
working out was when I moved to Davis
like my first time living alone and the
apartment complex that I lived in had a
at home gym so every day after school I
would go on the treadmill like 30 to 40
minutes and I would just do stuff on my
time and once I got used to that I
started going to these group classes it
was for like TRX and that's pretty much
like all these ropes and you're like
strength training and at first that was
really intimidating but the more I went
to it's just the more I got used to it
so it's all about just getting you know
getting yourself in the habit of it and
just the more times you do something the
more comfortable you'll be oh my mom
this combo simile Kym er asks what is
your guilty pleasure movie hands down
it's a walked remember that was my
favorite book and film back in the day
who didn't want a land into their Jamie
I feel like everyone I felt like Jamie
kind of like the outcast the good girl
and somehow the hawkeye in school just
like happens to fall in love with you
when he buys her new sweater my favorite
film anymore so good in it and just
gives me all the feels brings back a lot
of good memories for me is better the
soundtrack the soundtrack was so good
only hope that was a bigger the last
question comes from Jane Kelly has there
ever been a time that you wanted to quit
YouTube no there's never been a time
where I wanted to fully quit YouTube you
know throw down the towel it's never
been like that but there have been many
times where I've been frustrated with it
I think that's natural YouTube is a
completely different thing than what it
was when I first started because of that
I have been trying to grow with it as
well and I think that the beginning of
this year and also all of 2015 I
struggled a lot creatively trying to
stand out and I think a lot of it had to
do with me filming with a production
company I signed to do 52 videos for
them and that just fried my brain I was
creatively done like because on top of
that was still making YouTube videos
from our channel so it was a struggle
for sure and I was really stressed out
about it and I felt like I was comparing
myself to all other people when you're
on YouTube you see people who have like
crazy editing
FEX or like a crazy production team and
you just it's easy to get caught up in
that and feel so small but I realized
that comparing yourself really gets you
nowhere it's it's just literally you
just like flogging yourself because it's
not it's not gonna change anything and I
feel like mentally I'm in a lot better
state right now and I feel like
September and even August that's when
something just like lit up my ass is
that the same I don't know but something
clicked in my brain and I'm just
starting to put less pressure on myself
because I felt like I was always trying
to one-up myself always trying to evolve
and keep up with everything seeing what
everyone else was doing and trying to
stay afloat all in all what I'm trying
to say is that I'm in a better mental
state right now I'm doing videos that I
would want to see in my subscription
feed and I yeah this I couldn't imagine
quitting YouTube fully like it would
have to be a really really long time
before I do that alright everyone those
