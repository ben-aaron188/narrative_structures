hi everyone it's Jen I'm about to do my
first get ready with me video tonight
I'm going out with one of my closest
friends Stephanie and I always use a
night like this try out brand new look
that puts me completely out of my
comfort zone because strength and
confidence comes by putting yourself out
there so let's start off with my bare
naked face I'm gonna hydrate and
moisturize using this one by Clinique I
like it for the summer because it
absorbs really really fast and feels
light next up I'm dabbing on benefits
Porefessional primer to smooth out any
of my pores especially on my t-zone it
helps reduce shine and just makes my
makeup last on longer since I'm planning
on putting on lipstick I'm using Nivea's
milk and honey chopstick right now so
that way it'll sink in and be
moisturized by the time I'm gonna put my
lipstick on then I'm using Makeup
Forever HD foundation because it's my
favorite one to work with especially in
the summer
I used to use NARS sheer glow but then I
realized that my face got too oily for
it so I switched to Make Up For Ever HD
because it just keeps me matte then I'm
going to use Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer in light I dab it in a
Halfmoon shape right under my eyes and
then I'm going to use the same stippling
brush to blend it into my face after I'm
gonna go in with the same concealer but
in a different shade medium and then I'm
going to use that to just get rid of the
blemishes and the discoloration around
my nose I know the product says it's
only for under eyes but whatever I'm
gonna use it on my face because it's
cheap and it works for me after I'm
gonna go in with narses translucent
powder to seal in all my hard work and
mattify my face this is the new step
that I do for the nighttime I use Rimmel
stay matte powder to just target my
t-zone so that way when we use flash I'm
not a greaseball
now that the face stuff is finished
we're moving on to brows I'm using
Anastasia's brow Wiz in caramel I have
really sad and sparse eyebrows but it's
all good because I'm just going to draw
some in
I've been loving the straight brown look
which is kind of reminiscent to Sal
Nanda and Spock from Star Trek either
way I love it and that's all that
matters so I'm just gonna fill them in
until my brows look the way I wanted to
ever since I dyed my hair lighter I have
been using a brown tint to make it match
my hair color
since I didn't bleach them this one is
by Anastasia and it's been getting the
job done so I've been a really happy
camper we're shifting gears and moving
to eyeshadow so I'm putting on this
primer from Urban Decay and a little
goes a long way with this so after you
put it on just blend it out next I'm
using this eyeshadow stick from Wet n
Wild as a base for my eye shadow colors
this just makes the colors a lot more
vivid I'm putting it inside the inner
corner of my eyes and then the thirds of
my eyelids after that just blend it all
in with a clean finger now that my
eyelids are primed ready to go I'm using
my new lorac palette I got this from my
friend Claire I'll link her YouTube in
the description box but I've been using
this palette
ever since she gave it to me I'm gonna
get this light bronze color and then I'm
going to put it inside the inner corners
of my eye where I put the base and then
I'm going to go in for the gold color
and put it on the rest of my eyelids so
that way they're totally metallic and
just really awesome then we're gonna use
garne or garnet I'm going to use this
color as an eye contour so I'm going to
put it on the outer thirds of my eye and
don't worry about it looking all cracked
out and ugly cuz we're just gonna blend
this bad boy until it looks presentable
blending is everything when it comes to
makeup and it's a lesson that I'm still
working on - after you've blended up to
the best of your ability you're going to
take an angled brush and use garne on
the bottom thirds of your eye this is
going to make the eye shadow look a lot
more sultry and sexy
I'm using benefits highbrow glow to use
on my brow bone to add more dimension to
my face I honestly don't think it makes
a significant difference but I think
it's just fun to put on then you're
going to curl your lashes so we can prep
for mascara I use benefits they're real
mascara and it's been doing wonders for
my thin straight lashes so work the
product in all through the top and the
bottom of your lashes and if you're
blessed with lush thick lashes you can
just stop after the first coat but if
you're a mascara freak like me and want
the illusion of long lashes keep on
going I like to coat my lashes three
times because I like the look of nice
spidery lashes so after three coats I am
finished I love using NYC sunny it's one
of my favorite bronzers I'm really
shocked cuz I finally hit pan on this
thing after using it every day of around
a year it's definitely a trooper I put
it on my cheekbones and just around my
temples then I go in with benefits hoola
and use that to really really get in
there just kind of the edge of my
forehead to tone it down and just to
really emphasize the cheeks after I'm
going to move on to blush and coralista
is the bomb because when I use this I
don't have to use a highlight on my
cheeks because blush itself has a
beautiful natural glow and just add a
gorgeous flush of life back to my face
last step is lipstick since my eyes are
relatively neutral I'm going for a bold
pink lip I've been loving Mac's
chatterbox because it's a fantastic
punch of pink it's kind of the darker
shade and it's got somewhat of a glossy
finish and I love it because it fades
into a really pretty pink by the end of
the night so it's really low maintenance
now I'm moving on to hair these are the
things you're going to need to make some
gnarly 90s raver buns or puka buns
whatever you want to call it so I'm
really seeing the mane out of the bun
and then I'm going to divide my sections
or divide my hair into two sections
using the comb then I'm going to get one
side and make it into a
hi ponytail and do the exact step to the
other side you can go out like this if
you want to look like a little quirky
cocker spaniel or you can proceed to the
next step which is to twist it if you
have layers like me it's gonna be kind
of frustrating but just keep practicing
and force it to go your way
don't let your hair control you you're
going to twist it into a baby bun and
then grab some hair pins and just pin
the living crap out of it I use around 4
to 5 pins but definitely feel free to
use as many as you need after you're
going to do the next step to the other
side you should have these awesome
little buns on the top of your head as
the end result and I think this
hairstyle is perfect for sweltering hot
summer days especially for a music
festival
if this hairstyle is too wonky or even
atrocious if you will feel free to not
wear your hair like this and style it
how you normally would because I think
this makeup style really complements any
other looks now I'm moving on to the
outfit I usually like to start by
picking one item in my closet that I
want to wear and then kind of work
around that my mood combinations are
completely dictated by my mood and I
felt like going for all black I kind of
wanted to go for a Gothic Lolita anime
look and I guess this is what I came up
with I'm wearing these awesome unive
overalls from Karmaloop and I thought
this youthful silhouette would be
toughened up by a vampy long-sleeve I
really like the combination of it and
since it's cold in San Francisco I wore
these thigh highs and then to elongate
my legs even more I'm wearing these
crazy black platforms from misguided I
know this look isn't everyone's cup of
tea
but I feel like a superhero in this
getup and I think that's what fashion is
all about it's wearing what you like and
feeling good in it
