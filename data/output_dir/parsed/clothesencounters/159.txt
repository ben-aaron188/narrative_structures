gorgeous and incredible day I am so
happy even though we haven't gained
anything actually we drove by a couple
in and outs but they're on like the
opposite side and the time we noticed
that they were there we were like

up grab a bite to eat and then head on
over to the meeting we own the shuttle

eggs benedict with no hollandaise sauce
and an egg sandwich just like a
breakfast sandwich it's really intense
but we're very excited about this hmm
oh geez nothing beats getting woken up
to lots of food or a little bit of
sausage there hi guys welcome to day two
of Coachella last night was just
absolutely incredible I think it was one
of the best moments of my life
it was so insane and then had such an
incredible time as well everyone was
just on the same page with our group so
we had such a great time so today is
going to be a busy one we've got the
revolve event starting now we're gonna
head out right now

go to the Pandora tent at 4:30 and then
after all the Coachella badness we're
gonna head out to me on Carnaval so yes
Saturday is gonna be a huge one isn't it
Ben I'm very excited good look at your
red shirt I know this is the most
summary of ever in my life being I'm
still weighing bad genes yeah that's
true it feels comfy and I've got to deal
with it because it's very hot yeah yes
that was awesome last jumper Sonia it's
amazing when you get a group of friends
and you have it everyone's organized
have someone at the front some of the
back don't leave the group is like
walking dead without yeah zombies I
guess yeah yeah it's a good bite my body
sister yes everyone has to be non lethal
and it's good in your words we managed
to stay together all night

the day yeah
morning guys it is day three of
Coachella last day I'm so sad I'm having
such an amazing time here last night was
absolutely incredible it was so much fun
that I actually am losing my voice I
think by the end of day three I'm going
to lose my voice completely and fine
with that it's fine it's a little rest
but I was so fun
we saw Zed we saw thrills Susie we saw
soo are all grime I guess we're just
like listening to a lot of I like a lot
of electronic oh we did screen lays the
ice cube but I just grabbed a music
festival I just like doesn't really
translate even ASAP Rocky it was awesome
but like it I just don't think the sound
is insulated enough for like hip-hop I
don't know that's just me personally but
it was cool to see a legend on stage
unfortunately we did not get to see Guns
and Roses
little bummed about that but when your
new big group is difficult to like move
everybody over to the main stage because
we were all very cool at Sahara but yeah
I am kind of kicking myself right now
for not seeing Goodman roses but I don't
know man
Ben and I are going to head on over to
that ages event and then after we're
going to go to our friends house which
is where like Stephanie jarred Sophia
silence and you Ernie Louise Ashley Matt
they're all staying there so we're going
to pop them over to their house after we
have like a nice like dip in the pool
and then head out to the hustle together

weekend but yeah so I'll see you just

such a bittersweet feeling because on

the other hand one of the best weekend's
of my life has come to an end and I'm so
happy that I got to document it all
because I can look back at this moment
and just reminisce on one of the most
beautiful parts of my life and lastly I
am so thankful that Pandora drooler sent
me out they could have sent anyone else
but they chose me and a handful of girls
and I feel so so blessed that they sent
me thank you so much I'll never forget

constant screaming shrieking singing and
dancing so I think I'm just gonna sip on
a tea relax and yeah I hope you guys
