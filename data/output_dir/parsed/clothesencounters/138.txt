you
everyone is a girl Jen and Here I am in
my living room about to serve you a
fresh plate of favorites because as you
know July is done I would say that July
was probably my most favorite month
because it was the height of summer and
I was really really busy I think this is
the busiest month for me so far but yeah
enough chitchat let's get into the faves
let's start things off with fashion
first here I have my Spice Girls top
this has become my favorite go-to pajama
top and believe me I'm really picky with
pajama tops because they have to be one
a very very comfortable soft material
and two they have to look good with no
bra on and this top ticks both of those
boxes I really love how the vendor
customized this t-shirt by creating this
lace up detail up here I know that L F
sells something quite similar to this
for like a couple hundred dollars but I
got this for twenty-five dollars so
definitely a steal these days I've been
loving to rock that glossy lip and my
favorite lip gloss to us has been glam
glows plump rageous gloss lip treatment
I love opening this thing because I feel
like Inspector Gadget it took me forever
to realize how to open it at first but I
got there in the end
basically you twist the ends and then
the applicator pops out what I love
about this the most is definitely that
shine it's got a gorgeous glossy wet
look it's very hydrating it doesn't
leave your lips like filmy after a
couple hours it just settles in nicely
and it just leaves your lips looking
really natural and beautiful this does
leave a slight burning sensation on your
lips it's not painful by any means it's
just kind of like you have some hot
sauce on your lips which is a sensation
that I don't really mind anyway as you
all know I have very short lashes which
is why finding the perfect falsie is a
never-ending quest I have different
phases with lashes and my phase this
time is by blinking butte i actually
found these lashes in a very organic way
i was in new york and i realized that i
forgot to pack some lashes so I went on
Yelp and I found this little mom-and-pop
shop in New York and I found these on
the counter and I knew just by looking
at them that I would like them it's it's
like when you know you know these are
really great because they're more
dramatic than the our del W wispy but
less intense than like full-on mink ones
I think this is a really good balance
and I've been loving to wear these on
make tutorials or nights out I'm you've
been wearing them right now the band is
quite comfortable there are some
eyelashes where the band is so thick
that you literally can't see the top at
all so these lashes don't impair my
vision I like the way they make my eyes
look and that's all I can really say you
about these lashes last month I went to
Toronto for a Fuji film and castor and
pollux event and I had a meet-up there
and the turnout was amazing thank you to
everyone that showed up it was so
surreal getting to meet all of you guys
and for those who did show up I want to
thank you guys because you took time out
of your day to come see me and I'm so
grateful for that for those who I wasn't
able to meet I apologize there just
simply wasn't enough time to see all of
you guys and I guess that just means
that I have to come back to Toronto for
something that's a little bit longer
I got a fujifilm instax mini seven day
while I was there and no they're not
paying me to plug this in at all
I've I've already been a fan of Instax
before I had their old model which I
loved and used but their new model
definitely has some perks it's a lot
thinner it's lighter it's got some
digital aspects to it there's different
modes like selfie mode self timer this
is just easier to use I feel and this
has been a really great way to document
my July so hard because so much has
happened I got to take a ton of photos
in Toronto and my trip to Palm Springs
it's just so much more satisfying when
you have like a physical picture because
this world is so digital like digital
rains so it's nice to have something
that's analog so I'm gonna squeeze in a
TV favorite here and obviously it's
going to be stranger things I had to
check it out after all this hype on
Twitter Instagram Facebook you name it
this is one of the rare occasions where
the hype is 100% real
each episode had me clinging on to my
sheets and I just wanted I was like so
desperate to finish the season
me and Ben knocked it out in a span of
two days two or three days
and what it's over kind of wish you just
savored it because god this series is
amazing the show takes place in the
early 80s in Indiana and a little boy
named Will goes missing and the whole
town just wondering where the hell he is
and meanwhile all this weird stuff
starts happening so I'm just gonna leave
it at that this is definitely pretty
scary for me at least I probably
couldn't watch it alone but it's more of
a thriller than a horror if anything but
yeah I am dying for season two I hear
that it's happening so I'm pretty
excited obviously I have to save my most
random favorite for the last here I have
a snack that I've been enjoying these
are called the paleo thin crackers and I
actually learned about them from Chris
elf I was watching her five ways she
stays healthy video and these crackers
were one of the snacks that she was
promoting and I had to give it a try
especially because it only has five net
carbs per serving and before we get into
the whole debate of a high carb IRS's
low-carb diet just know that every body
is different and everybody eats a
different diet and all I know is that I
like these crackers they make me full I
like to eat them with my tomato soup Ben
has been making this this delicious
homemade tomato soup we got this blender
and you know when you make tomato soup
you have to put in the blender because
you have to get rid of all the chunks
but basically I've been liking to use
these crackers in the soup because it's
been very tasty alright guys so that's a
wrap of my favorites as usual if you
have any favorites of yours please write
them in the comments down below I love
to read about it and as for news I am
heading out to outside lands tomorrow

insane

beach house why I'm so excited for this
music festival and yes I will be

another thing my hair is lighter your
eyes are not deceiving you
annalee went lighter on me and I love it
