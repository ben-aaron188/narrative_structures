see difference I'm just putting like a
ton of texturizing spray this is dry
bars triple sec this is my favorite
hello hi Here I am at Toronto I feel
like I've just created like a smoke of
hairspray but I'm staying at the Drake
Hotel this is actually the exact same
room that I stayed in last year when I
came so it's like a little bit of just
just a lot of fond memories spilling
back in the last year didn't vlog so
this time I changed that so yesterday I
came in around like 8:30 p.m. I am here
in Toronto for a video shoot I am so
freaking excited this is something that
Danny and I just randomly planned like
three weeks ago at at my place and now
it's here it's happening I'm gonna go
get some breakfast downstairs because
the in-room dining service has been busy
for the past 30 minutes so I'm just
gonna go downstairs myself and then head
on over to the studio
ivana this isn't one of the cutest
little restaurants ever seen the flower
scheme is wonderful about the veggie
plate
these tickets
all right so this is our last scene of
the day and probably our favorite
because of that orange TV which they
have spray-painted and it still
functions it's amazing I love it
well done team thank you so much hi guys
I am back in my hotel room I'm sitting
like this because I'm not wearing any
pants
TMI I love love love love the team at
castor and pollux Sabrina Emma Leah and
of course Danny huh I love them so much
and today just lies it just couldn't
have gone better and I'm very very happy
it's all just like starting to sink in
now and it feels amazing I've always had
trouble processing things like I can't
be excited for something until it
actually happens so for example like
let's say I'm going on a trip to Japan
like I'm not gonna be excited until like
I'm in the plane sitting down and we're
taking off and like we're about to go to
Japan like that's when it all hits me so
I feel like with the launch of my
project coming out it's finally really
starting to feel real because here I am
in Toronto filming this and it just it
just feels so surreal and I feel so
grateful to have these opportunities so
yeah I've been here for a good hour so
I've just been working and editing over
there
but now I've done so Danny and I are
gonna meet up and we're about to have a
night we shot six looks today so we only
have to do two tomorrow so I think we
deserve you know to have a little
cocktail have a little dance and just
enjoy the city wait only fly don't ruin
my shot I'm here at the lovely Danny
she's still here
so yeah I love you so much
I love you anyway we just got a little
soup as our appetizer let's go check it
out tasty is Thursday it's also the last
day of the shoot today we only have two
looks I am wearing one of them right now
and this is the last world it is Shara
just an orange room with a bit of furry
blue stairs I love it what's up guys I
am back motel room the shoot went
amazing and I just wanted to shoot my
hotel room tour before I completely
forgot I am staying at the Drake Hotel
and I freaking love it so this is the
door that you come in you're greeted
with like a full-length mirror and then
another mirror here and then you walk in
you put your suitcases to the left and
here we have the nice spacious living
room you've got a little couch here
where you can watch TV and relax and I
guess you can host guests here on this
side there is a bar there is a medley of
alcohol choices and a little tiny
champagne bottle I may or may not have
drinking one last night and of course I
have my sippy cup I can't travel
anywhere without it and then over here
we've got the bedroom this is like a
nice king-size bed it's very comfortable
I've got some abstract art on top and I
like to sleep on the left side of the
bed so just all my essentials are there
the kindle Kettlecorn over here a little
desk area where you can work I've yet to
use that then over here I've got a
bathroom nice little setup shower over
here and then the toilet the throne
that concludes the hotel room tour I'm
just waiting for Danny now I believe we
are gonna go get some
Korean food for lunch and then we're
gonna go on that Tower
I always forget what it's called the
cyan CN tower well yeah we're gonna go
up there because that's like one of
Toronto's monuments or like landmarks so
we're gonna head on over there today's
mission is to go up on the CN Tower here
we go we're at the CN Tower and Jen's
about to fly
where you get
so it is the last day in Toronto I'm
leaving today
I just packed all my bags and I'm about
to head out into the lobby to meet up
with Danny we're gonna have like our
last brunch I suppose so
I still don't know where we're going you
think we're gonna go get dim sum perhaps
surprisingly I'm feeling pretty sad
about leaving I don't know something
about the city I really like it here I
like the people everyone is so nice and
everyone that I've met has been like so
creative and inspiring the food has been
bomb and I just generally just like the
fact that we could just walk around
everywhere I think we've walked like a
good five or six miles every single day
and it feels good I like being active
and I love exploring the city through
foot or by foot I think once I'm on the
plane I'll be like excited to go home
but I just want like a couple more days
here I definitely need to come back this
is an amazing city alright so we just
finished dim sum and now we are at the
Art Gallery of Ontario itself there's no
art in here in this room but just the
natural lighting
in the car you're heading to Jackie Inez
30th birthday poppy be more stoked the
dress code is all white so we're looking
fly in all life struggle for Steph Jude

a pretty good job exactly what you
wanted sly someone really good yeah and
I already had I only own like two white
tops and then I had to borrow a white
cami to go underneath it otherwise it's
gonna be like to see through yeah but

hi everybody good morning from New York
Here I am at the 60s Soho it is a very
nice hotel I'm in New York for a press
preview for my clothing line that's
coming out eggie I can finally talk
about it and I feel like this vlog is
really funny because you can see like
the different stages on how much
information it can reveal and how much I
can't I'm here to do a press preview if
you don't know what that is it's
basically like just a bunch of
interviews with publications explaining
and showcasing what the brand is and I
it's like my first time ever doing
anything like this so I'm just gonna
kind of take it with each interview and
that's all I can really do but I know
this is gonna be like really good
practice for me and a very very amazing
opportunity so I can't let a couple
nerves just shake me down it feels
really really nice to be in New York but
if I'm gonna be completely honest I do
feel just like a smidge bit fried from
how manic this month is and I can't
believe I'm here like I've just been
taking everything day by day and I feel
like every day has just been like just
over stimulation I rather be too busy
than too bored so definitely gonna count
this as a blessing Oh for my hair I'm
just doing like normal curls just doing
a couple N word a couple outward
something easy
good morning everybody
today is my final day in New York and
quite a big day I am at the Edition
Hotel in New York and this hotel is just
stunning and it smells amazing too so
far we've done WWD which was not gonna
lie pretty nerve-racking she had like a
tape recorder and I think so I'm like
really hard questions but I think I
managed to pull it together the article
comes out on the 21st I believe don't
call me on that but we'll see what she
has to say the line is up for preview
over here and it's so surreal of being
able to talk about it and have people
come in and touch the clothing and it's
been so amazing getting to explain
everything
I can't believe lunch day's really
coming up all right everybody that is a
wrap the racks are bare the mannequins
are naked
Ashleigh you had a tick off our sweater
thank you ah start the show Cole thank
you
and having lunch with me my favorite
and this is the spicy kale salad with
rice flour chickens like french fries
okay Karen
oh my god whoa whoa this is really good
she also got me a gift from Big Sur
says the California national flower
poppy oh nice thank you all you need to
grow a whole pot yes
Ben and I are going to be poppins of
children hobbies away
hi guys so I'm back from New York it
feels so good to be home and I'm still
kind of decompressing from my trip this
trip was actually a pretty big deal this
was the first time I've ever done
something like a press preview for and I
feel really confident in everything that
I did and I think that's like a big step
for me because even like earlier this
year I was always second-guessing myself
or replaying different situations that I
would have done differently but I really
just starting to let go it happened I
can't change it and I feel like a lot of
my mental growth has been through like
meditating and I feel really proud of
myself because last time I went to New
York was I think it was like in March or
something the end of March into April
but I was out in New York there for a
week and I was doing back-to-back shoots
my schedule was slammed and I actually
had like a pretty crazy meltdown I was
like crying in my hotel room feeling
really overwhelmed and I always thought
that that was just the cycle but I
really do enjoy working but there's
always like a threshold when I take up
too much on my plate and then I have to
have a release it's always been that way
and I've actually never opened up to you
guys because if you watch that vog I'm
like hey everybody I'm in New York and I
just completely cut out the part where
I'm like sobbing uncontrollably in my
hotel room I feel so much stronger now
and I'm in a place where I'm not like
regretting anything I'm just letting go
and I feel really proud of myself and I
feel so free finally like I I went to
New York did like I don't know it was
like seven interviews and I don't have
any regrets it's it's it's everything
has been done and I did the best that I
can and I have like my amazing team to
think for like I have um my clothing
line has a publicist his name is Cole
and he didn't
amazing job guiding me and walking me
through by talking points and of course
Ashley my manager I feel really proud
that I didn't have a meltdown gold star
for me I am all dolled up because I am
filming my techy haul this video is
gonna come out on Tuesday when my line
launches so I'm so so excited I don't
know I'm just so grateful for all the
opportunities that I've had this year
it's just been absolutely surreal um
thank you to everyone who said hi to me
in New York that was amazing just
literally walking down the street and I
meet like a handful of you guys every
time I've been walking around so that's
been an absolute gift that is truly like
my favorite way to meet you bye it's
just literally candid and pumped to
moments where you know I get to like
chat chat up where you guys are from and
while you're there but yeah I'm just
gonna finish up getting ready I gotta do
my hair and then get cracking with
foaming
you
you
