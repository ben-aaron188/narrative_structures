hey guys it's Jen I'm going to do what's
in my bag tag but I'm gonna do I'm using
my school bag because it's kind of like
a what's in my purse bonus because as
all my school stuff in it because
everything in my school bag I would have
or everything my purse would be my
school bag anyway so first off uh this
is the backpack that I use it's just a
Navy pleather backpack that I got at
Goodwill I think I got it for $7 I got
it the one in West Sacramento so if you
want check that out um go for it maybe
there's something cool for you there too
I thought I would customize it with
these pins that I got um these used to
be on my leather jacket but I just
transferred them onto here because I
thought it my backpack needed a little
bit more of a pizzazz factor first
pocket of just have a bunch of pens and
pencils I don't have a sell crap I don't
have a pencil bag but it's on my list of
things to get because I have a lot um I
have a lot of highlighters I have a
bunch of pens that I got a Sharpie pens
are my favorite because I write really
thick and hard on my paper and the
Sharpie just mix it even more bold and
doesn't bleed through on the other side
of the paper which I really like I have
a coupon from Target and oh it's not
expired yet cool more receipts God um I
gotta target a lot here's my iPhone I
got this for Christmas my dad got it for
me and uh the case actually came for
free with the phone so I don't know I
don't feel like it really exemplifies me
but I mean it protects my phone I would
really have just preferred a very like
clear and modest case but um this will
have to do and thanks dad if you're
watching uh it's been really cold in
Davis lately so uh I've been wearing
these pair of gloves that my friend
Rebecca gave me when we went on our
cabin trip and these have been keeping
me really warm so thanks Becca whenever
I go to the library to study or just
anywhere in general I always carry
around this and in this box I keep my um
my earplugs because I know silence is
golden brown and I used to get really
annoyed when I'll go to the library and
people are just like talking and like
texting and just all this stuff and so
instead of me being kind of like a brat
about it I just did something and just
got your plugs now I'm totally good
wherever I go and my USB stick it's for
homework you never know you never know
here my keys just for the house if you
guys plan on breaking in I always carry
around my iPod
I need it everywhere I listen to it when
I'm like shopping alone walking to class
driving wait on the bus just everything
this is just like my lifesaver
everything's just better when you have
your own soundtrack my housemate got it
for me it's it splits the earphones it
splits the sound and the earphones so um
one of your friends can plug it in one
hole and you can plug it in the other
and you guys can listen to the same
music um in the same iPod it's a very
intimate experience in my bag I have
another bag and in this bag I keep all
my kind of just essentials then then I
know I'm going to reach in for I always
put my lipstick of the day if I'm
wearing a lipstick that day I just put
it in here today I'm wearing Revlon's
why not and it's just kind of like a
deep berry color it's coming up a lot
more red than it is in real life it's
almost like purple in real life but it
looks really red on film okay well
that's what I'm wearing today I can't
live without these I run through a
bottle of these maybe like every two
weeks or not two weeks like three weeks
um because I wear soft lenses and I have
like crazy astigmatism so my eyes are
just constantly getting dry so this just
kind of helps lubricate them I have just
a mirror I got this at Daiso packet gum
this is my favorite gum of all time five
because the flavor lasts really long I'm
just like a crazy gum chewer I even have
like a different flavor this one is in
prism and this one's okay I like this
one better I really like spearmint I
here at chop stick which is Carmack's
my iOS bomb I think this is purely for
aesthetics though because I don't really
see that like the formula doesn't seem
very effective it just tastes really
good it's just really cute to put on
your lips but if my lips are crazy
chapped I'll bust out this baby got
lotion getting pretty dry up here blood
orange body butter and it smells so good
whenever I put it in class there's
always at least one person who comments
on it was like ah smells like it smells
like oranges or they'll say like awesome
Elle's like Jamba Juice I have my wallet
and this is just from forever 21 I
actually got the sticker of Burning Man
some half-naked guy was like do you like
dancing elephants and all
like yeah sure I love dancing elephants
so I just ran and gave me this sticker
and I don't normally I don't know what
it means but I think it looks pretty
cool and also just like a dying cat
another target receipt do you guys wanna
see my school ID well that's it wait I
drink a lot of water so I carry around a
water bottle with me and this is from
full Treach and it's BPA free I have my
umbrella and it's been raining a lot up
here I got this umbrella at the Tate
Modern it's really cool because when
moisture hits it it actually changes
colors it sure it turns into like a blue
and a yellow I'm not this is bad luck
probably is okay well that's it whatever
subject I'm setting that day I just
bring the textbook in class just in case
because sometimes after class I'll go to
the library and read that chapter
I'm also caring around The Unbearable
Lightness of being my housemate let me
borrow it because I really wanted to
read it isn't that cover like very
Magritte I don't know if you actually
design the thing or maybe it's just a
coincidence this is my bag so whenever I
have some free time I could just bust
this out and start reading it for each
class I take identica t'what entire
notebook for that subject so I'll just
put whatever classes I have that day and
their notebooks in my bag and so today I
was Oh today I was in comm 102 which is
like research methods like personalizing
stuff so I just cut out um a photo from
Allison's car Paula's photography um oh
and I learned about this photographer
from the youtuber sushi and clouds
I like creeped up on her actual blog and
she had like a whole post on Allison and
so I just fell in love there's like a
bunch of her photography on my walls too
