hi everyone she's a girl Jen and today
is such an exciting day for me because
my clothing line
eggie officially drops today even saying
that out loud is so surreal I was
working on this for such a long time
since the end of last year so I've been
keeping my lips sealed since then and
now I get to just you know break the
news edgy is baby in Korean and growing
up I was always the edgy in the family
and now this clothing line is an edgy of
my own this is a full-blown 27 piece
collection there is a lot to go through
and I thought for this first video I
would just you know break down each
piece explain where I got the
inspiration and showcase the items to
you guys in a good old fashioned hall
there's a lot of items in this
collection so let's get cracking so I'm
going to start off with the tops first
here I have this white rib t-shirt this
is called beach buggy baby t and I think
it's a really great easy everyday top
and it has eggy and Korean on the corner
and I thought I'd be really interesting
to make it 3d and fuzzy so it just has
like a Corky texture to it I went for a
mock neck just to make it stand out from
the rest of the graphic tees in the
market moving on to the next top here I
have my try again crop tee this comes in
three colors this blush yellow and then
black then I forgot to film blocks when
I was showing this in New York and I
press preview a lot of people were
asking me like what the smudge
it's just try again but all jumbled up
so it implies the viewer to try again to
decipher it
white tops have always been such a
staple in my wardrobe so that's why it
was really important for me to sprinkle
a couple in my line this is my rough
house blouse and I absolutely love it
it's really flowy looking number it's
got kind of like a Edwardian theme to it
with the color and the ruffles and the
sleeves as well it's got this lovely
white polka dot pattern all around it
and it just gives it a nice beautiful
dainty feel
I also recommend wearing this with a
nude banjo or a nude camisole just to
keep you more covered I've always loved
items with little catch phrases on it so
that's why I made
now what blouse this is the perfect
fitting white button-down that's a
little sexy but put together it also has
the words now and what embroidered onto
the lapel and I feel like this is saying
that you know it's applicable for a lot
of situations and you could even like
say like what now so they're
interchangeable over here we've got the
edgy hoodies this is incredibly
oversized slouchy comfy hoodie and I
just wanted to make sure that the
sleeves were extra long because I
thought it would be really cool for the
proportion on the sleeve there's also
eggy written on it with like an old
English font and there's also eggy on
the hood in Korean so that way you can
just kind of flash it tell everyone who
needs to be babied I've got another top
that is perfect for the Fall this is the
edgy long-sleeve I'm holding the orange
one but it also comes in white I love
both colorways and it's made in the
softest material it's just like a really
cozy fabric and I could totally see
myself wearing this as like on my pajama
shirt during the fall when it gets a
little colder this is also one of those
shirts that you can sleep in and then
like wake up and go out the next day and
very comfortable and easy on the go this
next item is the item to wear with
during the fall this is my mesh bodysuit
I love pairing this with just little
baby doll tees that are fitted because
it creates a really cool 90s effortless
look I can also imagine myself layering
this over like a fitted turtleneck or
even off the shoulder tops this is just
a really fun piece to experiment with
sweater weather is quickly approaching
so I wanted to have a nice snuggly jump
ring to my collection
this is in a beautiful I like shades and
it's like so perfectly 90s this is in
like a beyond soft material I swear like
once you put it on you don't want to
take it off and is actually like I have
a mistake because this was supposed to
have like a fish cake print all over it
but it didn't embroider correctly so we
decided to just X out the embroidery but
keep the actual sweater so now we are
done with the top and I want to talk
about this skirt I think red is such a
power color for the Fall
and I wanted to make sure that I really
utilized this fun color into this nice
skirt I really love this light breeze
material and I think that's the grommets
on the side and the lace detailing
really make it unique now let's move on
to the jumpsuit and the matching sets I
want to talk about the one that I'm
rocking right now this is called the
Dolores jumpsuit and it comes in two
prints the first print I want to talk
about is the Korean national flower
print wanted to incorporate some of my
Korean background into my collection
when I was going to Korean school we
sing this song called like Moo goo ma
and it's basically just praising our
beautiful national flower and I thought
it would just be the perfect print to
put on this jumpsuit this jumpsuit like
literally fits like a glove and it's got
pockets it hugs in all the right places
and I absolutely love the back as well
this also comes in gingham as you can
see and I guess this is incorporating
more of like my American background what
I think of gingham I think of picnics
and I named it Dolores because of
Dolores Park in San Francisco I had a
lot of picnics back there and it just
reminds me of good times that I feel
like this jumpsuit would be perfect to
wear you know eating outdoors and
enjoying food and friends next up I've
got the egg yolk food this is in a nice
beige color but it's got a little kick
to it because of the checkered striping
on the sides and the armpit I thought
that the checkers went perfectly with
the gingham print like look it's
literally the same thing but I don't
know I just thought I would go really
well together and tie in the nice theme
this is a perfect little outfit they can
wear at the airport or school or
whenever you just want to blast through
errands but stay comfy so I love wearing
matching sets and this one is extra
special to me because it has my favorite
fruits printed on them this is the
Korean melon and it's called the chummy
and I ate these so much while growing up
as a kid my mom would cut these up after
dinner and eat them for dessert and
these are just absolutely delicious if
you never tried a Korean melon I highly
recommend that you do this is a really
fashion-forward piece and I love the
pockets on the skirt those are a game
changer for sure and if you don't like
the melon print it also comes in a
stretched version
and this is identical to the melon set
but it's in a slightly different fabric
like it's a little thicker so I'll keep
you kind of warmer so if you live in a
colder place this will keep you maybe 5%
warmer so let's chat about the naughty
top and wide trousers set I feel like
this is perfect for the in-between
summer to fall transition phase because
the top is still very appropriate for
the summer and for the bottoms these are
just a great fitting culottes
they're such an amazing fit and you can
rock these pants in a business setting
this also comes in black so it's even
easier to mix and match with items that
are already in your closet alright
everybody let's move on over to the
outerwear pieces this is my tuxedo
blazer and I am just obsessed with the
striped print it's so bold and it
coordinates really well with the stripe
set that I showed earlier
I just love statement jackets and you'll
really be making a splash in this one
this also comes in a black color and I
find that these types of jackets are
always my go-to when I want to find a
coat for the evening so this next jacket
is my favorite one it's the truck along
patent jacket this is in a really flashy
material it's so sick and just so unique
and it's fun to wear I wanted to make
sure that it came in red and black
depending on everyone's comfort level I
would say to try the black one if you're
just kind of dipping your toes into this
material this jacket adds so much
personality to any look and all eyes
will be on you when you're watching this
next of in line I have the edgy bomber
I love huge oversized bombers this is
basically supposed to be like a bomber
that like your boyfriend's letting you
borrow or you stole it's got like a nice
flout sheet fit it's perfect and warm
for those fall and winter days to come I
love cardigans that double as a blanket
so here I have my cozy cardigan it's so
long it's like floor-length and you
rigidly wrap around in it like a little
burrito and you're just so comfortable
and cozy you throw it over anything and
it instantly along gates you my last
coat is a blazer
it's called gingham thing obviously I
wanted to keep the gingham and the
checkered theme in my collection so I
thought we just bust out a blazer in
this fun print throw it on over any
couch
look for a polished feel and also this
blazer is so well made its line it's got
pockets and it's just everything you
would want in a blazer
I can't wait to style this in a future
video so we are at the last category now
we're going to be tackling the dresses
this is the cheeky slip and I have
obviously being this dressed after my
dog this is essentially a body con dress
but with the twist and it's perfect to
wear on nice out where you just want to
dance and just have some fun the next
dress is called the del V and I actually
named this after a bar that been nice to
go to it's in the mission and it's just
like a really romantic spot where you
sip on cocktails and get to know someone
really well and this dress is just a
really cool in-between of just like
casual and formal it's casual because of
the material before Mille because of the
silhouette my last dress is called the
shine slip this is just my version of
the classic little black dress the
straps are adjustable and we try to make
them as thin as possible so we can make
it even more delicate and it also has
these sexy cutouts on the side and the
material has a nice soft Sheen to it
alright guys that is the end of this
massive eggy launch I can't believe that
each and every one of these pieces are
in my own line and I feel so proud and
excited to share this all with you feel

to thank you guys for giving me this
opportunity to even have a clothing line
because without you this would have
never ever happened I have been on
YouTube for seven years and I have been
putting my everything into this channel
and building this relationship with you
guys if I told my 18 year old self that
I would have my own clothing line I
wouldn't have believed it and I also
would have been terrified because when I
first started youtube I was so lost I
was really struggling when I first
started this channel I got rejected to
all my dream schools I was going to
Community College I was working at a
smoothie shop and I just felt like I was
letting everyone down in my life and
