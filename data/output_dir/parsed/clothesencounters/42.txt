- Today is the day of my lunch.
We are at the Lombardi House
and check out this freaking barn, guys!
Look at this installation,
these are all balloons!
And, they're weighted perfectly
by some water balloons.
So, it's just
perfectly balanced.
I literally can't believe it.
Now I'm just waiting for all
my friends to come through.
This is amazing!
Absolutely incredible!
I'm just,
my emotions are everywhere,
I couldn't be happier. (laughs)
(whimsical music)
- Hey!
We are all sitting down now
about to nom
on some freaking delicious food.
I'm so excited about this!
- This is the menu I picked out myself.
A lot of Korean bites,
we got kimchi fried rice.
(whimsical keyboard music)
-  Speech, speech, speech!
- Thank you guys so much for being here.
You guys could have been
anywhere in the world,
but you chose to come to my lunch,
and I am so grateful.
This whole experience has just been
just incredibly surreal
and I feel so lucky
to know each and every single one of you.
Each one of you guys have made
such an impact on my life
whether you know it or not,
and thank you so much for being here.
Cheers!
(crowd cheers)
(whimsical keyboard music)
- What a freaking day!
It is 9:30 now
and I just ordered some food on Postmates.
I didn't really know what I was craving,
and then I just thought,
you know what, I'm just gonna go for some
classic burgers and fries
and onion rings.
(laughs)
This place is called Burgerim.
I thought it was really funny
because it's got my last name in it.
But, yeah,
today was so unbelievable.
I couldn't even believe
what happened.
It just, everything happened so quickly.
Today was one of the
fastest days of my life,
and I just feel so grateful for
all my friends that showed up
and for the support that I received
and also reading all you guys' comments
about the line has been so encouraging
and I can't thank you guys enough.
I feel good.
I think when I first got home,
I was just completely drained
because it was a whole group of,
I think around,
50 people were there,
trying to get every single one of them.
It was so fun,
but now I just need to just recharge,
be alone,
enjoy these,
these fries.
Look, look.
They're like the shape of a potato chip,
but they're french fries.
That's good,
that's real good.
I bought three burgers,
which is really cool.
I'm at a point where if 2017
is the year that I peak,
I am at peace with that as well.
I lived a freaking blessed life,
and I am just,
I'm just over the moon.
Thank you guys so much.
I'm gonna enjoy this now
and watch my YouTube videos.
-  Yeah, whatever.
-  Listen, if Game of
Thrones can mess with time,
so can we.
-  Yeah, that's true.
-  (laughs)
- Hey guys!
So it is 5 o'clock, I'm
stuck in rush hour traffic,
which is very unfortunate.
I'm driving back from the Pop
Sugar interview that I did.
I did an episode of Pretty
Unfiltered with Kirby,
she was so wonderful!
What a great host!
And, everybody at the Pop Sugar family,
so nice, love them.
And, it was cool doing
that whole experience,
because she asked a lot of questions
that I normally don't get asked.
For example,
like my Korean-American background
and what it was like being
just Asian-American growing up.
The plan is I'm gonna to pick up Cheeky
and then I'm gonna drive
over to my parents house.
I haven't seen my dad in like three weeks.
So, it would be really nice to see him.
And, I don't know,
I know when I see them I'm
gonna feel a lot better.
I think I'm just having one of those days
where I just feel kind of off
and I'm being way too hard on myself
because I know the interview went fine,
I just,
I'm just like picking myself apart.
-  (laughs)
Cheeky, go play with Haraguchi.
(laughs)
For tonight's menu, oma has made
bokkeumbap!
-  Bokkeumbap.
- And then of course,
kimchi chicken!
(speaks in foreign language)
 Mm-hmm.
- Mm, mm.
Too much salt.
 Too much salt?
-  So, this is my mom,
wearing the wide trouser pant outfit.
 (speaks in foreign language)
-  (speaks in foreign language)
Very comfortable, huh?
- Very comfortable.
 (laughs)
(both speaking in foreign language)
-  (laughs)
-  (speaks in foreign language)
-  Oma, model.
(whimsical keyboard music)
- Wow!
I love!
Thank you so much!
- You're welcome.
(whimsical keyboard music)
-  Ashley, the boss.
Rev's outfit is on!
Oh my gosh!
Looks like a spider.
(whimsical keyboard music)
- So amazing!

Everyone arrived all at once.
- Uh-huh, promptly.
We have a sushi chef.

- Two.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm stoked.
They already gave us a
little sampler and it was-
- It's already gone.
- Pretty good.
- I literally ate it all, it was me.
I had like five pieces.
- Oh my God!
- I'm hungry!
I've been waiting for this moment since-
- Slow your roll turbo.
I know, actually didn't
eat that much today
so I'm ready.
My body is ready.
- Body is ready.
- Yeah!
(whimsical keyboard music)
♫ Happy birthday to you!
(cheers)
-  Blow em out!
- Oh!
Shut the fuck up!
 Yeah!
(cheers)
-  What?
Oh my god!
(cheers)
-  So, we're having
the Game of Thrones finale
party at our house.
We got sushi from Steph's
birthday last night.
Got some burgers and veggie burgers,
sausages.
Got Ben's famous potato salad.
-  Potato salad. (laughs)
♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish!
♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish!
♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish!
♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish!
 (hums Game of Thrones theme music)
(whimsical keyboard music)
- Hello everybody!
- Hello!
- We are here at Delilah's!
- In the private room, so fancy!
- Private.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
- We're here for a Calpak event.
They've invited a selection of girls
and we're just here to
just enjoy some food,
and look at some new products.
- Yeah.
There's some gifts over there
that we can see, you can't see it,
but I'm excited to,
to open them up!
(laughs)
- (laughs)
- I'm excited to,
open them up!
I was like, what did
you get Dana? (laughs)
- Look at this bountiful feast
of ketchup. (laughs)
Wait, look how big it is! (laughs)
-  It's the size
of your hand! (laughs)
Oh my God!
And, I was thinking about
french fries all day y'all.
-  Yeah, she was.
-  I manifested this plate of fries.
-  (laughs)
(whimsical DJ music)
- Look who it is!
- Hi!
- Ingrid!
- This is our first time hanging
out and meeting each other.
Which is so crazy!
Like, how have we not met before? (laughs)
- Seriously!
- I know!
- No, but I've been watching you for like,
such a long time.
You were one of the first
people I saw on YouTube, so-
- I know! I remember you as like,
one of the people from
like back in the day.
One of the first like fashion people
that I was aware of, so-
- Wow.
- I know, it's like two
oldies coming together.
- I know, right!
And, she's at my house now, so-
- I know, it's so crazy!
- Hey everybody!
This is the most recent version of me
and, as I was editing this,
I realized that I've done it again.
I ended the vlog super abruptly so,
giving you an outro.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
And yes, stating the obvious,
I do have bangs now.
I was getting my hair colored by Anna and,
I was just like,
"Should I get bangs?"
And she's like,
"Yeah, Chaz is right
there, you can ask him."
And, it just happened so suddenly,
but I'm so happy with the change.
I know whenever like
drastic differences happen
people really like to put
in their two cents in.
But, I just really, really wanted a change
and hair just grows out
at the end of the day.
So, if you don't like it,
it's gonna be back to normal
in the next couple of months.
So, chill out!
I am vlogging all of September.
I've already missed a couple days,
but, I think I'm just
gonna do like a, you know,
my monthly compilation as usual.
Thank you guys so much for watching,
and, I will see you guys on the next one!
Bye!
