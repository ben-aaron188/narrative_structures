- Hello, everybody!
It is December 1st, here
I am in New Orleans.
I am here for vacation
with my brother and Ben
and I'm so excited to just relax
and spend some time with them.
So, back in September, for
my brother's 30th birthday,
I gave him a roundtrip ticket
to anywhere around the U.S.
And we decided to pick New Orleans
because we've never been here
and there's just so much of
the United States that
we haven't explored,
so, yeah, we're finally here.
This is our Airbnb.
I will give you guys
a tour in a little bit
but right now we're
gonna go grab some dinner
because we're starving.
Hopefully we're gonna get some seafood.
(smooth music)
Oh, that's good.
So we are at the oldest
bar in the United States.
-  Purple.
-  Yeah, I got a purple daiquiri.
-  We were warned about
this from our Uber driver.
-  Yeah, he said
that a lot of people
black out from this, so.
- What Jenn got.
- Yeah, of course.
Good morning.
Here is our breakfast.
I've got a veggie omelet.
James got the--
-  Chicken and biscuits.
- And then Ben.
- Steak and eggs.
- Steak and eggs.
- It is 12:14.
This is our first meal of the day.
We're absolutely starving.
- Yes.
- And the excitement, I'm hungover.
(laughing)
So this is gonna help.
(upbeat music)
♪ I think about loving you ♪
- Cheers, yay.
- No more hangover.
We have a Camembert here, we have a Gouda,
which I hear is very good-a.
And we have a Manchego, Manchego.
♪ Loving you ♪
(smooth upbeat music)
-  All right, the
fried oysters are here.
They smell delicious.
♪ I think about loving you ♪
♪ I think about ♪
- Good morning, it is Sunday.
Eating a very large salad
for breakfast because
we've been having a really
gnarly weekend of crazy food.
So, gonna throw some health in here.
We're at a vegan restaurant called Seed.
- It's really good.
- And it's just right across
the street from our
Airbnb, so very convenient.
♪ Loving you ♪
- All right, we made it
to the swamp in one piece.
That was so convenient.
- It was so easy.
- Real easy.
- Yeah.
They picked us up and now we're here.
- Now we're here by the water.
It's very nice, lovely day.
- Mm-hm.
I think this is the beginning of the swamp
but it just looks like a really nice dock.
There's an airboat that
we will get on later.
(smooth upbeat music)
Good morning, it is our
last day here in New Orleans
and I realized that I didn't
even get to show you guys
the Airbnb that we stayed at.
It was lovely, it felt very central.
But yeah, I'll give you guys a little tour
of the space before we head out.
Over here we have a lovely living room.
Over here is the kitchen.
We did not cook at all but
we did eat a lot of chips.
We have the room that Ben and I stayed in.
- Hey, guys.
-  Ben is packing up shop here.
-  Been a lovely time.
- And then over here we have James' room.
Hello!
- Hi.
- But yeah, this is the
apartment that we stayed at.
It was so wonderful, very
clean and comfortable.
I think we did a really
great choice in the Airbnb
because we were just really happy and
every time we got back home,
it really felt like home.
We are gonna pack up all our things,
we're gonna go for breakfast.
Unfortunately, I got a little cold.
The sniffles are in full force right now.
It is not fun.
(smooth jazz music)
All right, we're all
sitting down at the table.
Got Ashley.
(smooth music)
Currently on a hike with Cheeki and Ellie.
Looking at the beautiful sunset.
-  For a milestone we're going
to reach and meet this year, so.
- Hello, everybody, happy Monday.
I feel like I have been vlogging a lot but
I haven't had a chance just to sit down
and explain and process
everything that has happened,
so I'm just going to
backtrack a little bit,
talk about my New Orleans trip
because that was incredible.
I loved the fact that I got
to travel with my brother and Ben,
two very close male figures in my life
and it was just a freaking amazing trip.
Everything felt effortless
and I loved that
we all contributed equally, whether it was
getting the Uber or finding
out a cool restaurant or
arranging the swamp tour.
Me and my brother are so
similar and it's crazy,
'cause I never thought that
we would be this close.
And this relationship
was not always like this.
I don't want to get too into it,
but, basically, when we were younger,
we hung out together every single day,
we were best friends, and
then middle school happened
and then we just stopped
talking until college,
until after I graduated college.
That was a big gap to just not
be speaking with your brother
so I'm glad we're past that phase
and we're at a good terrain now.
It's awesome getting to see Ben
and James just bond as well.
We all just needed some more quality time
and New Orleans is such
a freaking great city.
It's so underrated.
The food is amazing, the
people are incredible,
and just the architecture
and the community
is just so lighthearted and resilient and
I just really, really love New Orleans.
If you haven't checked it out,
I highly recommend you go.
And then we went to the
Refinery29 29 rooms installation.
That was such a cool exhibition.
Basically, Refinery29 does this every year
but they create 29
different installations.
So, each room signifies
something different.
If you love the arts, I highly recommend
you guys go check it out.
And then, of course, there
was the Unforgettable Gala.
This was my second time attending and
this experience was completely different,
because last year, I was presenting
and I was presenting the last award,
so I was so nervous
about going on that stage
that the entire time I was just like
I was there but I wasn't present
because I was so, like, anxious about,
you know, speaking in front of everybody.
So this time around, I was just a guest.
And it was just so inspiring being around
the Asian American community.
After that gala, it reminded me that
it's beyond just showcasing
your fashion, style, and beauty.
This is about visibility and the fact that
growing up as an Asian American woman,
there was nobody that looked
like me in traditional media.
So it only makes sense that growing up
I felt like I couldn't do anything.
I felt powerless, I felt like the
great opportunities in entertainment
was only for people that
looked a certain type
and I knew that I wasn't it.
And the fact that Asian Americans
are pressing the boundaries and
living our passion even though
the traditional Asian parent
tells us to go the safe route,
they tell us to be a doctor
or a lawyer or a scientist
or something, or engineer.
That's what the traditional path is
and so to be able to
do what I want to do and express the way
I want to express myself is so empowering
and that night was just incredible.
When I woke up today, I
felt pretty overwhelmed
because there were a lot of
things to do on the agenda.
The holiday drop for Eggie
is happening next week,
so I have been preparing
for all of this for
the entire month, so I'm
just at the final finish line
and then I need to head to the gym
because it's just good for my mind.
I have been going to the
gym pretty regularly but
I haven't made it a
habit to bring my camera.
It's because when I'm there, at the gym,
I already don't want to be there
and the last thing I want
to do is, you know, film.
But yeah, I've been going to the gym
and every time I come back from the gym,
I feel like a new person, so,
it's really for my mental health.
(smooth music)
Hello, everybody, happy Tuesday.
Currently in traffic on
the way to the West side.
Today is the Eggie holiday lifestyle shoot
and I'm really excited because
we got Mel Joy to be the face of it.
I'm so excited.
This shoot is gonna be in Abbot Kinney
and so it's gonna be really awesome
and hopefully there's
some festive things that
go along with the collection.
Also, I got my nails done yesterday.
They're in this really cool,
rose gold, chrome finish
and I really love it.
Normally I don't go for stuff like this,
I just kind of go with something natural
or just basic because I,
I don't know, I just want
my nails to look polished,
but I don't really care about designs,
but since it's the holiday season,
I thought I would splurge a little
and get something a little special.
All right, we are shooting
Eggie Holiday Three Collection.
We've got Mel's outfits over here.
She's got kind of more of like
a street style fashion vibe,
so everything's casual
and there's pops of color.
- This is such good quality.
- Thank you, yeah.
- What is this?
- So this is the Canon T3i,
I threw on a wide-angle lense,
but yeah.
- This is great.
- Thank you.
- Hi, everyone.
- Yeah, this is Mel.
- We're here in LA, about to film.
I'm so excited, the clothes are so cute,
make sure to check them out.
- Thank you.
- They're so adorable.
- Yeah, she's wearing the
lateshift trouser here,
it looks so sick.
- I love this.
- So she's gonna be the face
of Holiday Three Collection
and she's from the Bay Area.
- Yeah, Bay represent!
- Hi, Mochi Bear.
I never showed this to
you guys, but I bought,
oh, you can see me through the screen.
But I bought the Nintendo Switch
and it was supposed to be for me and Ben,
but it turns out I'm the
only person playing it.
Also, because I'm hogging
it most of the time
because I'm playing this game.
It's called Stardew Valley.
This is my little farm and
it's kind of like FarmVille
but way better
and there's just a lot
more things you can do.
So right now I am on my second spring
and these are all my crops.
I've watered all of
them and I got my horse.
If you don't have a horse,
you gotta get on that
because it's freaking amazing.
You get to go around
the town so much faster.
There's my dog.
My dog's name is Chippo
in this game as well.
But basically, this is my
little world that I go into
because sometimes when I
just want to take a break,
it's hard for me to relax and watch
YouTube or go on Instagram
because sometimes
it just feels like
work, so, when I come on
this lovely farm, it's
like my own little escape
and it's very, very, very relaxing.
A little guide for more comfort
and joy by Courtney Carver.
When I think about all the times
I was wrapped up in the pursuit of more,
it's clear that I really did want more.
I just finished reading for a podcast
called Optimal Living Daily.
It is one of my favorite
productivity podcasts.
So, every day, the host, Justin Malik,
he reads out blog posts about
minimalism and productivity and
Amy reached out and
asked me, or asked him,
if we could both read for his podcast
'cause it's always been a dream of mine
and now it happened,
so, I'm really excited.
I will definitely let you know when that,
or when my episode comes out,
I'll blasting it on my social media
'cause I'm really excited about this.
So Ben just made some cod,
is that what this fish is?
-  Yeah.
-  Some cod, green beans,
and some roasted potatoes.
I've got some wine and the
Great British Bake Off.
(smooth music)
All right, for dinner tonight,
Ben is making veggie burgers.
Yum!
- We've got enough in
the fridge but we just
thought we'll go for a
nice, simple veggie burger.
Gonna get some sweet corn,
some tomato, some onion.
-  Oh, and, yes,
red onion, my favorite.
- Got some raw as well.
- I know.
-  So that your breath is lovely.
-  I know, well I'm only
smooching one person tonight.
- That's true, then I'll be
stinking of onion too, so.
(laughing)
Together.
-  Also, I didn't
get to vlog this but
Ben and I spent last week decorating
the inside of our home.
It looks fairly festive.
-  Festive enough.
- Festive enough, yeah.
- There needs to be more.
-  I wrapped this
lovely tinsel garland
all across the stairs.
I feel like it has a really
nice holiday element to it.
And lastly we have our
festive Christmas tree.
We got this at Home Depot
and, yes, it is fake--
-  Get over with it.
- I mean, I've always had
a fake Christmas tree.
Tomorrow is actually a really huge day.
We are shooting the Eggie Holiday Lookbook
and it's gonna be with LR Creative,
so I'm really excited to
be teaming with them again
because I feel like
they are such creatives
and I love that we're all not
afraid to try something new,
so this one's gonna be
pretty interesting and fun.
Oh, wow, where do I get started?
Is this my red onion?
-  Well, you
shouldn't have all of it,
so I was just gonna
have whatever you don't.
- Oh.
I would eat all this red onion, though.
- Once when me and Jenn were first dating,
she sent me a photo of a
burger or sandwich she made.
- Yeah.
- And there was literally half
a block of red onion in there.
- And then I took a bite into
it and I was like, "God."
Good morning, everybody,
it is Thursday at 11 a.m.
Today we are shooting the
Eggie Holiday Lookbook.
I'm with my crew from LR Creative.
It's gonna be a dance party,
it's gonna be real, real fun.
We've got a hazer here.
Vu, can you walk us through this machine?
- So, it's, like, a fog machine.
It basically it is, but
it uses different liquid.
So it creates more of a atmosphere
versus, like, just a thick cloud of smoke.
-  Oh.
(smooth music)
- So, basically, fire
alarm all the way up there.
We need to turn it off because
we've got a haze machine.
Somehow, we need to try and reach it, so,
we're getting pillows, plus Trevor,
plus me on top, and we're
gonna try and get it.
And, first of all,
health and safety people,
look, I know, we'll put it back in,
everything's fine, it's just a hazer.
No fires are going on.
This is my crash landing.
- You can step on my
back, just don't kill me.
-  Okay.
(light music)
Yay.
-  Yes.
- This is like one of the most luxurious.
(laughing)
It's high on the new thing.
On the camera, that's not that high.
It takes Trevor plus me plus Vu.
- How tall are you, Trevor?
- I'm like 6'4.
- And I'm not.
- I was--
- How about this?
Just behind her like this?
How about just like this?
I'll do the thing.
- This okay?
(vocalizing)
(laughing)
-  What is that?
-  This is Ben's laser.
These are Trevor's lasers.
Oh my god.
- Oh my god.
- It's crazy.
Whoa.
Oh my goodness.
The shoot is finally over and
it couldn't have gone better.
It was incredible and I'm stoked.
It also involves a lot
of dancing and, honestly,
if someone had brought
this video idea up to me,
like, a year ago, I would've been like,
"No, absolutely not, I'm
not doing that," but,
this year is the year
where I am testing myself
and I want to get out of
my comfort zone because
you can't get out of your comfort zone
if you don't actually
go out of it, I mean.
But yeah, this video's
gonna be really fun.
I just want to make a disclaimer that
this video is not meant
to be taken seriously.
It's supposed to be lighthearted
and just a good time.
It's meant to showcase
that you can have a party
wherever you are, including your home.
So yeah, I hope you guys enjoy it.
Anyway, I am gonna get freshened up
because Ben and I are going
to Sophie and Si's place.
They're having us over for,
just, like, dinner and some games.
A lot of people are leaving
for the holiday season, so,
this is just our last hurrah
before everybody dissipates.
So, yeah, it's gonna be great.
I am Sophie and Si's place.
Look at their beautiful
charcuterie spread.
I love this.
Hi, Weylie.
(laughing)
Okay, who goes first?
- I will go first.
- Oldest person goes first.
-  Oldest person.
- I have wings but I can't fly.
There are more of me
than any other bird on--
-  Chicken!
- Yes.
- Yay!
- Boo!
(upbeat music)
(overlapping chatter)
-  Freeway, highway!
- Yeah.
Hello, everybody, it is Friday.
So, yeah, I guess that wraps up
the first episode of Jennglebells.
I shall continue vlogging
for the rest of the month
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye!
(smooth music)
