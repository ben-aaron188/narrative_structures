look found me too smiley face for
breakfast no it's sad well done then
thanks babe that's for the best
it is day five of jingle bells I just
got another shower I did not do a
workout today today's my day off it's
Saturday whatever I'm just giving you a
heads up and letting you know that I'm
probably not gonna get that much footage
today because today is the day that I'm
cooking my parents dinner if you watched
my bucket list video then he knew that I
was going to do that and today is that
day and yeah I'm actually filming that
so I will be filming today technically
but it's not gonna go inside this vlog
it's gonna come out in a separate video
I'm just going to put on some makeup now
and get ready so we can go to the
grocery store I just wanted to show you
guys my new makeup brush holder I really
love it it's from Lulu in Georgia and I
think it's supposed to be a like a
flower pot but I thought makeup brushes
would suit it much better
all right guys a lot has happened since
the last time I saw you I've been kind
of running around with been trying to
get all the stuff that we need for the
three-course meal for my family video
it's really hard to film a cooking video
I realized so we have this tripod and we
had it all set up here and Ben was
making sure everything was centered okay
oh yeah yeah that was important and then
so now we've got everything prepped and
primed oh look how beautiful it's all
displayed so this is just for the
Balinese this is the main course that
I'm making and I'm going to use the
liquor set pot that Stephanie got me for
my birthday and robot to make a really
really tasty dinner Oh Momo pushpa Oh
big mistake on my little side
I like this okay I thought about mokoosh
bop boose buggy good you have no choice
hi also Ben was here the entire time oh
god I'm very hungover
I went out last night wasn't a girl um
for her brother's birthday Ben stayed in
I didn't even have that many drinks I
think I'm like three drinks I feel awful
my stomach is in pain my head hurts
and I woke up and I got a text from been
saying that he's upstairs watching the
Liverpool game we have like a
recreational area up on top and then I
woke up and then I saw that he gave me
like a little hangover kit how sweet we
have the sippy cup of water and then he
got a little Tylenol and then baraka
which is kind of like an emergency ah
I'm gonna be on the road to recovery
soon okay Chacko Belle's day mmm
dare you six jungle Belle's
day 600 Billy oh thank you oh so happy I
had my early already so I went down
recovery road and I'm feeling 100 feel
awesome now I took a shower I put my
makeup on and in case you're wondering
on my lips I'm wearing this by Lancome
does not have a name it just called 362
very creative it's just a really great
pinky coral and I just splash it on my
lips and I really like the applicator
it's like a cute little doe foot like
this is like my favorite of applicator
because it just looks so cute it's like
a little animal foot so today we are
heading out to lunch with my friend
jean-claude
be the first time Ben's meeting you yeah
little about yes phone he's probably the
most artistic person I know he's always
doing something that's whether it's
music oh
all right so we just finished lunch
that's over house and we managed to get
a few clips in I did get told off when I
was doing the panoramic view of LA to
get fun I had a great time we had a lot
of food and to make courses and masterda
supposed to share by another the whole
thing so that's probably why we're not
going for a hike anymore yeah we were
gonna but I don't know we like Proctor
hiking clothes and everything but it
just does not seem like it's possible
right now we're gonna go home now and
have a nice relaxed lazy Sunday lazy
Sunday hi guys welcome to day 7 of
jingle bells I've already started my
morning I had breakfast obviously went
to the gym put on my outfit feeling good
Ben is also feeling good right so we are
gonna go get some lunch and I think it's
gonna be Korean food but if you're a lot
creepy about well then it's sorted then
um but before we head out for lunch I
wanted to show you an order I made at
Zoo Xu I got some shoes for the holidays
so I thought I would do a quick little
haul
look I even set up a little stage okay
so the first pair of shoes I got are
these ones we check these out they're
very tall which I love and they're just
a nice classic lace-up boot that I can
wear with dresses and everything second
pair of shoes are these bad boys it's a
nice winter white color and I'm going to
get a lot of wear out of them third pair
of shoes are these sexy little cage guys
look at that there's Steve Madden and
they've got a really interesting waffle
pattern and I saved the best for last
Diddy oh gosh they are these gold
platform sandals absolutely stunning
I think Prada or Miu Miu I think it was
Prada Prada had a shoe that looked
identical to this but that was three
grand and these are only I want to save
40 bucks not sure but what a steal and
that's the end of my shoe haul let's go
get lunch
as you can see there's so many dishes
and this like that stressful good stress
in order to get amount of food to
we get some fuel we are here at cafe
concerto it's a place Argent's from
Emily for our friend Emily our friends
gestured and it's very nice with outside
it's a beautiful day because this la I'm
just gonna do some work and have some
iced coffee order two iced coffees
having to work here for an hour lunch
was great
my nose is sweating it was a really
spicy lunch but I enjoyed it
my stomach might not agree with it later
but right now I'm editing the November
outfit diaries which seems strange that
I'm like that there's like a more recent
vlog up because jungle dolls was
literally last week and then November
outfit Diaries was a complete month ago
so I just feel a little bit redundant
editing this footage but I mean it's
better than it just staying in the
archives hopefully have this out by
tomorrow guess where I'm at here's a
clue timber these furry friends yeah I'm
Emma and just these plays oh you know
what it's gin what's called jingle bells
ex what you can't tell here but I have
roots and is gonna fix that I brought my
laptop because I have to edit because
tomorrow I will have no time so I must
get it out today this is the secret
formula on my hair you have one for your
hairline uh-huh and then the one for
everywhere else all right we're both
matching kind of wet stripes vibe nice
nice
someone likes color and their wardrobe
oh we're little worry stripes outfit
change holy crap I'm good it's the new
trend it's like a good like preview if I
did go bald yeah
everyone welcome to jungle bells number
eight today is the day we're filming the
New Year's Eve video the whole crews
here hey guys good morning and today is
jungle Belle's number nine yesterday was
very long but it was so rewarding
because I know that the video is going
to come out so amazing um today we're
shooting Stephanie's part so they're
gonna be a quick segment so who's gonna
come to my place around 11:30 and we're
gonna head on over to her house the
morning was the usual breakfast coffee
emails and I just got a notification my
building saying that they're gonna turn
off the water any time from 9:00 a.m. to
5:00 p.m. and so that makes me feel
weird about working out because I can't
not cleanse myself after I go to the gym
so basically been fill the tub up with
hot water and so after after I workout
I'm gonna go take a nice traditional
bath fun who gets to go first anyway I
better get going before boo comes all
right so we're at Stephanie's house I'm
here with boo so we're just gonna do her
a quick bit right here it should be
really fast
what's on the menu I made leftover
turkey chili from yesterday they made a
little quesadilla with eggs and avocado
hmm
so we're not being on these cookies
right now oh so amazing there's an Oreo
in this cookie cookie session so the
YouTube rewind video came out and there
I am for a millisecond it's on 3:17
there's stuff being supportive it was
like six or seven hours of being on set
for this for this second and those are
not my clothes by the way I helped it
not rumba rumba come here oh I have a
trained him yet
hello everyone welcome to day 10 of
jingle bells I am out of the shower I
think this is my favorite feeling after
I've had a workout and then I take a
shower and I'm just feeling all the
endorphins feels good right now I am
just editing I'm doing the family dinner
video right now and so I'm just adding
the text and putting all the clips
together and this is taking a lot longer
than I expected so I've been working on
this all of last night and now this
morning
watch Liverpool game right how are they
doing no Neville's a really game so far
and it's supposed to the end so fast
words lunchtime Baron has created a
stir-fry with noodles yeah we didn't
have that much less so we got all sorts
in here but um I'm gonna use these uh
well they called um
miracle noodles cobs like no calories
basically yeah it's a little bit too
good to be true they sell them at
Ralph's yeah let me show you a pack of
it how you smell no they don't taste of
anything at all it doesn't taste as good
as pasta but look isn't this crazy look
at all these these statements what
number did we are under Grove doing some
Christmas shop
this is our best bet because there are a
lot of fancy stores here we're going to
head on to anthropology and there's a
top shop here there is an apple store
everything yeah so let's get shopping to
this so we're back home only took us a
good 40 minutes to get back home we are
gonna have dinner with my brother but
before he gets here I wanted to do a
quick little haul of the stuff that I
did it's going to be a very vague haul
because I don't know who's watching this
this gift right here is for Stephanie
and then I got something very fancy at
Barney's and this is also a gift and
then I got something for myself I got
this at Topshop I couldn't say no
there's just so many great things about
it first
it says Oakland California on and I
lived in Oakland for a year so I have
great memories there and then September
is my birthday month and 1985 is the
year Ben was born so come on I hope
James come soon because I'm so hungry
it's affecting my mood this is the end
of jungle bells day 10 got my brother in
the mix got been in the mix good night
