yo hey guys it's me Jen welcome back to
my channel today I'll be filming my
apartment tour I love to document each
living space I've ever lived in because
I love reminiscing and if I don't
document now then I might just forget
about it so yeah without further ado let
me show you around
alright guys let's start from my hallway
so right when you enter you are greeted
with two shelves of shoes I believe
these are from Ikea and I think this is
just a really great way for me to
organize and store and keep track of all
my shoes I'm going to walk down the
hallway on the left we have a very
neglected vanity and to the right we
have my closet this is where I keep all
my winter jackets and coats I definitely
have way too many for someone who lives
in LA on the Left I have a half bathroom
here this is where you know guests use
the restroom or if Ben and I both have
to use the restroom
we each got our own toilets now we are
approaching the common area I'm just
gonna veer to the right and talk about
this area I guess this is my office I
have my bookshelf and I really like the
first two shelves and then it starts
getting real real cluttered by the third
and fourth but yeah I just keep my books
here some knickknacks some sentimental
photos jewelry over here we have my desk
which is where I do most of my editing
and the only problem with having a glass
table is the fact that there's no
shelves or storage on the sides so
that's why I have this filing cabinet a
lot of my important documents are in
there and then I have a smaller filing
cabinet just to keep like my random
knickknacks like my headphones some
stamps envelopes this is my computer
chair and if I could go back in time
probably wouldn't purchase this it was
one uncomfortable chair and one of the
wheels fell off to our left we have the
kitchen and I didn't have to get a
dining table because I had this table
bit right here I just got these four bar
stools from Crate and Barrel and I was
just able to eat here I love
cooking here because all the counter
space in really choppier four days mix a
bowl here there was a ton of room for
storage with all these cabinets I was
able to put all my pots pans stuff from
the pantry all that stuff I even had a
separate pantry just killer and this is
where I have when a sad little minibar
got Salvador Dali over there a wall of
knickknacks
I just couldn't build this away but
there was no other place in this
apartment to have it so I kept it there
and right over here is where I kept most
of my cups and plates and lastly we have
the fridge on the left corner I have a
photo of me and Ben at Cinna SPEA we
watched psycho and I was amazing alright
so here is the living room I've just set
this really nice blue tapestry rug from
Pottery Barn and on top of that I have
my marble coffee table over here I have
my big couch this is from Z Gallerie and
unfortunately this is not going to be
coming with me to my new place this is
just like the last time I ever buy
anything suede it's a super high
maintenance fabric and literally any
drop of moisture will just leave an
indent on the couch so I am getting rid
of this on the side you've got my lovely
plant spike he's just you know kind of a
droopy looking guy but he adds a nice
color to the room to our right I have my
vanity this is where I get ready every
single morning and I need natural light
to do my makeup so this corner is
perfect for that so here is the
entertainment section if you will I've
got a TV and this Media Console and the
matching shelf are from West Elm I
believe so I'm going to turn you around
and here we have the bedroom got a
queen-size bed the bed frame is from
world market I believe and I think
Claire and Whaley both have this bed
frame so it is a youtuber favorite to
the right I have my mirror this one is
from Lulu and Georgia and I call this a
fat mirror because it makes you look
bigger than you actually are
I'm going to move on over to the left
and here I have this gold media console
this one is from Pottery Barn
these lucite cases aren't part of this
console at all
I bought each of these boxes separately
from website called glam boxes calm and
I just thought it would be a really good
idea on how to store my sunglasses I try
to store my jewelry in here but it's
obviously a shitshow so I need to figure
out a better way to keep my I guess
accessories organized and on top of here
I have two pieces of artwork this is
just like a Flying Lotus flyer and on to
the rightness is a movie poster of one
of my favorite films the holy mountain
over here I have my nightstand this is
from Urban Outfitters and it just has a
bunch of drawers in it each box is a
complete mess I'm not going to show you
what's in there on top I've got some of
my favorite books on the side and then
I've got my perfumes and then a lamp now
I'm going to spin you around and here
are my two extra closets they're both
rammed right now this is stuff that I
want to wear and to the left this is
where I keep all my black and whites and
over here we've got my bathroom this is
the full bathroom we've got this weird
deer with a bunch of my hair extensions
in which I never wear to the left we've
got another leaning bookshelf this has
just a bunch of fragrances perfumes just
a bunch of beauty stuff you know over
here we've got two sinks got one for me
got one for Ben very convenient I've got
the shower here not much else to say
about that and over here we've got the
washer and dryer alright guys so that's
a wrap on my house tour yes I'm wearing
something completely different because I
filmed this in two days the Sun went
down the first day so I had to wake up
in the morning and film it again but
yeah I'm really gonna miss living here

where I lived the past year and a half
so yeah thank you so much for watching
