what's up guys it's your girl Jen and
today we've got a styling video as a
fashion enthusiast I've gone through so
many different types of clothes but
there are a handful of items in my
wardrobe that I just simply can't let go
of and today I thought I would showcase
them to you in this video all of these
items I've styled in my channel in the
past so I thought this would be a fun
treat for all you og subs out there if
you're a fan of styling videos or
fashion videos make sure you subscribe
to my channel I upload twice a week or
Target best upload twice a week but
definitely every Sunday so with that
said let's get on with the program first
up on the roster I have to talk about
the American Apparel disco pants here
they are these have gone through a lot
and if you're in the scene from 2007 to
2010 you owned these pants or you wanted
to own these pants Sara was working at
American Apparel and so we got that 50%
off discount hell yes but this is how I
spelled it back in the day I decided to
wear it with this really cropped denim
jacket from Goodwill this was literally
from the children's section and then I
paired it with a gold lace top that I
decided to not and looking back that
long not that's just sitting on the
crotch it just looks it just looks very
phallic and yeah I just really like
doing those knots back in the day and
this is how I would style these pants
today honestly I still think that these
pants are fire I love them I decided to
wear them with a more muted palette I
wore a fitted floral top that adds a
nice feminine flutter and then I toughen
it back up with this oversized Levi's
denim jacket to elongate the body I wore
these patent boots from Zara and these
pants just bring back so many members to
me and now that American Apparel is gone
rest in retail paradise maybe these
pants will collect in value maybe
they'll be like a vintage hipster era
piece next up I've got this old rat tee
and I believe this was my first vintage
piece that I've ever purchased when I
was 17 I kind of had this phase with
metal and when I saw this shirt at way
flan on Melrose I had to have it it was
over $100 and I remember all my friends
kind of like talked me out of it being
like Jen you're gonna spend your entire
paycheck on this shirt I didn't care I
just I had to get it it was this urge
that was within me like a guttural
feeling and I'm we're at the register I
gave the money and a part of me was sad
because I just spent my entire paycheck
but a part of me was so happy that I
finally had something that rat on it and
I remember going home and cutting off
the the neck and cutting off the sleeves
and now looking back I kind of regret
that because I kind of wish it was just
a normal t-shirt and this is how I
founded it back in Davis this was for my
how I style banshees I paired it with
some denim cutoffs with the six gold
studying on the pockets honestly I'm
just kind of wondering where those
shorts are now but I thought that they
would look really cool when paired with
this huge chunky gold necklace and then
I get to soften it I added this little
crochet cardigan and some black boots I
think this outfit is still cute actually
but maybe I would just switch out the
necklace for something a little bit more
demure slash back to the nail this is
how I styled it today I decided to style
it in more of a rockabilly style if you
will I pulled the tank down to make it
look like an off the shoulder top then I
tucked it into these gingham trousers I
slipped into some suede mary-jane
platform and then for accessories I
added a cool kinky belt and a little
bandana as a choker I really love that I
have this piece today it just brings
back so much sentimental value because
I've always worked really hard for my
belongings and this was this is
definitely a milestone for me to own my
first vintage banty alright so my next
piece is also from wasteland
it's these acid-washed denim shorts
these are also vintage and I believe I
bought these at the wasteland in San
Francisco when I was 19 years old
they've always just been a really great
fit and I still love an acid wash moment
so I haven't been able to let it go I
found this old clip of me wearing these
shorts I wore the shorts with this cute
floral crop top tank and then added this
western belt along with this contro hat
to accessorize I think this outfit is
still super cute you go young Jen so
this is how I sell the
in 2017 I went for a light-blue theme
and paired the shorts with this
off-the-shoulder roughly blouse and I
used the same belt as my last outfit
because I couldn't find my white one
sorry then I just wore some nude mules
to let the rest of the outfit shine I
always bust these shorts out in the
summertime I feel like that 80's
bleached look looks great in LA heat so
we've got another van key and this is
one of my prized possessions it's this
Pink Floyd pink I got this at the Rose
Bowl flea market I want to say when I
was 20 years old I remember that summer
it was super hot and we came to this
vendor who just had huge mounds of
clothing like just piles of clothing and
it was all dirty and I remember just
like fleeing through trying to find
something and it was like dirty
underwear and there it was really gross
but when I landed on this I was like I
couldn't believe my eyes and this top
was actually a huge t-shirt which I wish
I I just wish I didn't cut it but I saw
this my heart stopped it is double sided
so it's like two T's and one and I
remember when I was going to the vendor
I had like a pile like five things and
I'll just try to play a cool as if I
didn't know the value of this but yeah
in the end I got it for six dollars and
this is an absolute goldmine to me this
is how I styled it in 2010 I wore it
with a vest from forever 21 and then a
maroon skirt that was also from forever
21 at the time I worked there so I just
had a lot of clothes from there we only
got a 10% discount though so that was
not very fortunate anyway I decided to
wear it with these buckled sandals and I
always wore socks with these sandals
because these sandals were so
uncomfortable I didn't out get blisters
and that's how I made it work so this is
how I would sell it today instead of
being all over the place with color I
decided to let the blue really shine and
pop through I added this plaid faded
print vest to layer and to make the
outfit look a little bit more
interesting I tucked in the tank in this
killer a buckle skirt and then I wore
these thigh high soft boots from sananda
to accessorize I had to throw on a beret
because that's just not just what I like
to do these days to this day Pink Floyd
still remains when my favorite bands of
all time
and Dark Side of the Moon changed my
life that album changed my life and I
know it sounds really cliche to say but
it's the truth
I remember I was 18 when I first started
to really listen to the album and
there's this one distinct memory I have
with me my friend listening to it in my
car and we were in a parking lot and
we're just looking at all the lights and
the song time came on and we were really
focusing on the lyrics and we were just
like what it's about the concept of time
and how when you're younger it feels
like you've just got all the time in the
world they're almost like bored and when
you're older you're just always rushing
to find time and by the time you know it
you're you're freaking dead so yeah
definitely check out that album suzhou
funny I look like Pink Floyd's like
number one fan right now I'm wearing two
t-shirts right now but yeah these are
both vintage but nothing beats this one
because I actually had a really really
fight and dig for it moving on to the
last item here I have this red plaid
blazer this is from kaisalmi and this is
an online Korean store that I used to
work with all the time I love their
products things were quality things were
lined but yeah every time I wore this I
felt powerful I felt like a boss and I
just loved this red punchy color this is
how I styled it back in the day I was a
blazer with a lace button-down and then
some high-waisted black shorts just like
a classic and then I wrapped a little
beret and some mary-jane pumps and
honestly I would wear this outfit in a
heartbeat and it was a little
challenging to style it not in that way
because I just naturally I just want to
wear a beret with this blazer so let's
fast forward to today I styled the
Blazer in an Allred outfit and I just
went super bold with it I paired it with
a red top from LPA and then this awesome
circle / discords giving me total mod
lives I wore nude heels for a safe bet
and some dangly little gold earrings I
just love this look and how unapologetic
it is I'm still in a search for matching
bottoms that would go with this blazer
it would be my dream to make this
matching set so if you guys ever see
like a red tartan pant like this hit me
up because I need to complete this suit
so those are all the outfits and five
pieces that I just
and then I just can't let go from my
wardrobe if you would like to comment

just can't get rid of in your closet
