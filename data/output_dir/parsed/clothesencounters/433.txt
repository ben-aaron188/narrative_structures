hey guys let's stop this video has been
pushed back far too long now but it's
raining and I thought it would be the
perfect opportunity to do this in the
summer I put out a video asking you guys
to ask me a bunch of questions so I can
put it inside this FAQ video and Here I
am several months later answering them
for you but I'm gonna start off with
just general you know stats about myself
um first off I am 22 years old I'm
korean-american I live in Northern
California I used to live in Southern
California like a year ago but I moved
up here for school so that being said
let's get into it
Kaycee cowgirl 97 asks how tall are you
I'm 5-1 and I think the number one thing
that people who approach me who watch my
videos
always say wow you're so small and I'm
like this is this is what you get man so
I don't know so if you ever see me don't
be taken aback by my height that is in
fact me that small thing walking across
the balls asks what's your major do you
work and study
my major is communication and I am a
full-time student and I if you haven't
guessed it YouTube is my job and I would
say it's equivalent to a full-time job I
spend a lot of my time and energy in my
videos and I've been a lot of love into
it because I genuinely enjoy doing this
this is the best job I've ever had and
that says a lot because I've been
working since I was 15 years old right
when I can get a work permit I got it
and I started working at Baskin Robbins
I've done so many jobs in the past I've
done food I've done I've done retail
I've done what else had ever done Bakery
I guess its food but just a lot of
service and service jobs and I never in
my life was I excited to go to work it
was just kind of thing where I was able
to pay some bills you know but now I I'm
so lucky and blessed to be able to do
what I like and enjoy and be able to
support myself doing this and I wouldn't
be able to do this without you guys so
thank you so much for your support and
for watching my videos it means so much
to me thank you
how EMT asks what kind of camera do you
use I use the Canon t3i funky Munky
1987's where did Sara go I'm gonna put a
link to Sara's goodbye video in the
description box that's gonna really tell
you you know in detail on what happened
but the cliffnotes is I moved up to
Northern California for school and
distance just made it really hard for us
to do the videos together 80 wipes 83
asks how do you curl your hair I use a
Conair curling wand I think it's around
one inch and I just wrap each section of
hair for 5 to 7 seconds let it go spray
some hairspray on it and I'm done
I'm probably gonna do a video about this
just a soul video about how I curl my
hair because it's something that I get
asked quite frequently one two six eight
five one two asks could you say a
sentence in Korean and you guys have
genuine me that hands-on video powder
shows all comes have me that apparently
I have a really strange accent while
talking in Korean and I think it's a
fusion between like country because my
mom is from like the country part or
like this hot to do part but yeah you
can make fun of me about it I don't care
super-stretch la asks do you like kpop
and if that's the case what's your
favorite Korean group or artist no I
don't want a kpop but then again I don't
listen to pop music in general
regardless of what language it is and if
you're under a lot of music I'm
interested I'm gonna put a link to my 8
tracks account in the description box
and that should give you a general sense
on what my musical tastes are oh so
lovely smile asks hey Jen what type of
books do you like to read any
recommendations for fiction
I have Kafka on the shore and this is my
my favorite Murakami novel and that's
really tough because a lot of his books
are really good there's some pretty
tripped-out material in here so be
prepared to have your mind blown
hmm for a nonfiction and motivating book
I have Malcolm Gladwell's tipping point
and I got the book as a gift when I was
19 and I don't know where it is which
was bugging the crap out of me but it
really puts things into perspective and
shows you how small events and actions
lead to like huge social phenomena and
there's a lot of examples and he's a
really clear concise writer which I
really enjoy about him and he's great
speaker to Philo printed 31 asks when
did you start wearing heels it was off
and on in high school
I only saved them for like Wednesday's
with late start so I had a little bit
more time to get ready and Fridays I
really started to wear them actively
once I graduated this is one me and
Sarah we're really going out regularly
at night and I think that's when I
started to get really comfortable with
heels and trust me you're gonna fall
you're gonna trip stumble gonna eat
basically but that's how you learn and
I'm definitely guilty of you know
stumbling around you're gradually gonna
get accustomed to the height and you
know a little bit of the it certainty
but it gets easier trust me and don't be
scared to trip because each trip is a
little lesson Jacqueline Jacqueline
Ramos asks what's the best concert
you've attended and where the top five
bands you want to see before you die
okay that's really hard because every
concert experience is so different I
guess looking at on an average I like
shows that are you know small and very
intimate and a lot of shows in San
Francisco are surprisingly really dead
it's weird
I saw a yacht and twin sister and there
was like 20 people in the prow is insane
and so I was able to be right in the
front really magical being able to see
the man that you love play each song
note by note and I think seeing a band
live just makes you appreciate the music
so much more it's insane as for the top
five bands I want to see before I die
I would say Radiohead although I saw
them last year but I had nosebleed seats
I would I was far away I couldn't see
anything Tom York was like the size of
like my fingernail or like half my
fingernail Flaming Lips but if they
heavily focused on your shoe battles the
congruence album um there are other
stuff I just really can't get into but
that's just me being a brat
I'd say Portishead little dragon and def
Punk because I don't think I'm ever
gonna see them play live ever
Brenda's 27 asks what's your favorite
quote that's the best revenge of all
happiness nothing drives people crazy er
than seeing someone live a good
life I'm not sure where the source of
the quote is because it's obviously not
one of his books I think it's um from an
interview but anyway I saw the quote on
tumblr a few years ago and it was at a
time when I was feeling like bitter it
really shifted me out of this really
crappy mental state
and I was able to focus my energy on to
doing activities that made me happier
and in the long run I think it really
helped me out
Kate SMO asks what were you like in high
school and also when did you start
developing your own sense of style okay
I'm just gonna be honest with you guys
in high school I was really insecure I
was jealous of everybody everybody had
something that I didn't have and I
wanted it and it was just really really
self-destructive and I just was very
unhappy in high school I think we all
intrinsically have our own personal
sense of style within us and even if it
means that you start off by mimicking
someone's outfit style my outfit by
outfit it's not identical in a sense
because still being filtered and
siphoned through your own perspective so
it still got your twist in it you know
all of you guys had your own personal
style all of you guys just inherently in
you but it's up to you to kind of take
out lift those mental blocks in your
head like what are people don't think
about me or um they're gonna think I'm
crazy or I'm trying too hard or like I
really can't pull this off because
that's all mental it's on your head and
once you lift that you're free and you
just feel a lot more happier and
confident with yourself it's gonna come
gradually and in due time you're
eventually gonna stop caring so just
hunt that thought in your mind and do it
for yourself you know do what makes you
happy
frosted cupcake lol 72 asks where do you
get most of your style inspiration
everywhere my mood people I see
mannequins the Internet um but mostly my
mood there's no one source that I get
everything from Capri's 1212 asks what's
your favorite food and dessert that's a
tough one because my food choices are
always kind of they all these fluctuate
you know but I definitely have my faces
I had this long face of where I just was
in love with Burmese food I still love
it now but just not as much you think
I'd kind of went overkill with it but I
love their bloodbath I think I
pronounced it I'm not sure and their tea
leaf salad is so freaking good
um but generally I love anything that's
really really spicy so I love Mexican
food I love
types of Asian foods my palate is pretty
much open to anything as long as it
tastes good dessert I love ice cream
cake but I feel like it's not pushed out
anymore like I think the only place I
see ice cream cake is that the grocery
store in that weird baked goods aisle
and they're all like no one I feel like
no one buys them I don't think I've seen
an ice cream cake at like a social
gathering in decades leap'd Gaara asks
hey genin since Breaking Bad isn't
starting again until next year what
other shows do you watch slash recommend
thanks first off props to you for
watching Breaking Bad I can't believe
they divided the last season up it's
such a tease
the only other shows i watch on The
Colbert Report and that's for my little
watered down humorous political intake
for the day and it kind of works out for
me I'm also a big fan of Parks and
Recreation what's a great show it's
really funny and smart sorry I take off
my turban because that was kind of
overheating um but let's continue on in
mah flight asks can we be BFFs and start
an all-girl punk band hell yeah who can
be the next bikini kill so practice
starts November 37 31st at 8 p.m. so
meet me here ok LX one one seven zero
one asks what do you want to do after
you graduate like what's your realistic
dream job I definitely want to continue
this YouTube channel my complete dream
job would be probably like a video
personality for now on TV just like
interviewing bands and designers but I
wouldn't mind doing something behind the
scenes either you know like researching
cool new stuff the bottom line I just
want to have a really cool group of
coworkers because I'm going to spend a
large portion of my time with them
Looney Limbo asks also where would you
like to travel sometime in the future
like the ultimate trip I have to go to
Easter Island before I die I've been
saying that forever but I got a go man
and I want to visit India I hear that
it's kind of like visiting a different
dimension especially for Westerners I'd
love to be able to expose myself to an
experience like that one love story asks
hmm what's your favorite word like
something that you think is unusual or
not used often sesquipedalian and it's
essentially means a long word I was told
that it means someone who uses long
words and I don't know I think it's
funny
Christel Matt asks what's your favorite
cheese and do you like to eat it with
something in particular
I love mimma let's it's amazing with
pears baby pink day 99 asks how do you
stay motivated stay in college any tips
I like to think of it as kind of a
vacation or kind of a rehab tupa thing
because this is the portion of your life
where your job is to learn things and
you know retain information you have the
opportunity to learn anything at this at
the stage of your life you have you know
like-minded peers around you and you
have professors that you can you know
mind-probe and get the information out
if you're not planning on going to grad
school this is the last time you'll ever
be doing this so enjoy it because you
have the rest of your life to work
hermès sli's asks since you're over 21
do you drink
if so what's your favorite drink yes I
do drink I've been just drinking whiskey
for a few months now and I finally
figured out my own little system if I'm
feeling kind of spending that day I'll
get a bullet on the rocks and if I'm you
know really low in cash
I'll go get a Jim Beam and sometimes I
treat myself I'll get a beer and I love
Belgian beers so good my favorites are
shimei blue and the fin du monde and fin
du matt has a really high alcohol intake
so watch out zero loss to music zero
asks boo hey what time of day is your
favorite probably 2 p.m. I really like
early afternoons
oh it's 2 14 right now sick oh you can't
see it but it's 2 14 right now MIB t 11
asks if you're a pizza topping
what would you be I be a mushroom or
little chunks of garlic in the pizza
night fire Darcy asks what's your
favorite scent or perfume / body mists
and all that jazz I don't really have a
favorite scent because I don't own
anything I mean I own I don't like an
Escada thing but it's very rare that I
wear it generally I just stick to like
laundry detergent or like my deodorant
smell if you have any Arab nations odd
perfumes that are like you know fruity
and citrusy and sweet but not like too
roaming please let me know because I
want to smell good I I write drew Hass
asked how long did you take to grow out
your hair and what would you do in a
zombie apocalypse I would say six years
I mean I don't know I didn't really keep
track on how long my hair was but it's
been it's been this long for a really
long time but for your zombie question I
would be the first for you to just give
up you know bite me man because I
couldn't take living in fear I I don't
know the anxiety would kill me in itself
die one bleeped asks I'm going to
Community College this fall how was your
experience at Community College do you
recommend it my two years at community
college felt like it like an extension
of high school I think after when I
transferred I really appreciated it
because I don't think I was I would be
able to control myself fail if I was 18
living completely on my own you know
just being being able to do whatever f I
want just a word of advice for people
who are planning to go to Community
College if you're applying to transfer
please don't get stuck there it's so
easy to get comfortable there and pretty
soon like the years will just fly by you
know so go to your counselor make a road
map to so you can really find out when
you can graduate or when you can
transfer Rachel of sunshine asks how'd
you lose so much weight you always look
great but it looks like you've lost a
lot more weight over the past year I
actually did lose a bit of weight 10
pounds to be exact I wasn't planning on
losing 10 pounds but it just kind of
happened because um I think I'm gonna
make a video just entirely on my weight
and my diet regime I guess but here are
some guidelines I severely limited my
carb intake and that helped a lot and I
documented all my meals
I cut out juices and sodas since high
school so I mean that was already like a
good baseline to start off with but you
all just go more into detail in that
video
and lastly californian asks if you're a
unicorn what would you look like draw it
and show us this would be it I mean I
would say it's pretty standard I'm kind
of a thick unicorn but you know probably
grazing a lot and I'm magical and I
guess that's what I look like I don't
know I don't have anything what
say about it that concludes the end of
my video I hope I've answered a lot of
your questions and I hope you guys got
