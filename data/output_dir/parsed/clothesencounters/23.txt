(slow instrumental music)
- Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn.
And today I am filming my fall haul.
Bu this isn't just your
normal, average haul
because I'll be talking about
all the new items from
Eggie drop number two.
For those who are just tuning in,
Eggie is my clothing line,
and I've put my blood
sweat and tears into this
and I'm so proud of this collection.
This season is inspired by my past,
specifically high school
and like early college.
So that's why there is a variety of
hoodies, long sleeves, tanks
and also just modern
trends that I love today.
Just a nice mix-match of everything.
I've already uploaded the video look book
so please hit the cards or the down bar.
But I honestly just wanted to sit down
and talk about each item piece-by-piece
in a good old-fashioned haul.
So let's get started.
I wanna chat about outerwear first,
so here is the Tardy Bomber.
This is the perfect fitted bomber
that everybody needs in their wardrobe.
I put it in this really flashy red
because I feel like red
is a statement color
that's here to stay.
You can obviously wear it
just zipped up normally,
or you can just simply
snap the top button and
leave the rest open.
I feel like that's just a
really chic way to style it.
In the last collection we had
a really oversized bomber,
but I thought for this
season I'd dial it back,
create something that is
slightly cropped, more snug,
and perfect for the chilly weather.
Next up I have the Tardy Hoodie.
This is a really cute oversized hoodie
with this amazing chain detail.
At first we were just gonna
have normal drawstrings,
but I thought we would
just amp it up a notch
and add this chain detail.
I made sure that you could remove it,
so that way when you wash
it it doesn't get all rusty.
So you can wear the chain in two ways.
You can either just wear it like this,
or you can loop the chains together
and create kind of like a necklace effect.
I feel like with this hoodie
you don't need to accessorize
because the chain does all the talking.
It also has these massive balloon sleeves
that are very long.
But there is like a cuff detail,
so if they're just too long
and you wanna be able to function,
you can just push it
up and be on your way.
So I have another
comfortable hoodie for you.
This is called the Left and Right Hoodie,
and I named it that
because it has left and right
in Korean on the pockets.
So it says (speaks Korean) on this side
and (speaks Korean) on the other.
And this is a longer hoodie so
that way it covers your butt.
You can wear it as a dress
or you can just wear it over
like a jeans and a t-shirt.
This is something that
is super easy to style,
a wardrobe basic and very very cozy.
So this is the last piece of outerwear
and it is called the two tone hoodie.
It comes in two color ways.
One is in this nice beige and white
and the other is in a red and gray.
And I just wore a lot of
hoodies in high school,
and I wanted to just jazz it up
by making something mismatched.
I feel like this hoodie
would also look really cute
with some thigh-highs,
or you can just wear it
like off the shoulder as a dress.
I think that would be super cute.
But yeah I think this
is a really fun piece
to wear on its own or to layer with.
Now I'm gonna move on to some tops.
Here is a no-brainer basic.
This is called the Charlotte top,
and yes this is named after
Charlotte from Sex and the City
because it's elegant and chic.
This comes in two color
ways, black and periwinkle.
And it has this lettuce
ribbing all over the top,
and a cute keyhole that you can adjust.
The size does run a little bit large,
so make sure if you are
interested in this to size down.
The next item is a really
sentimental one to me.
This is called the Love Letter Romper.
So basically I went
into my childhood room,
and I found this box of letters.
And I thought it'd be really
cool to put them up on a shirt.
So on the left side I've got a letter
from my very first
boyfriend when I was 13.
And then on the right side
I've got a love letter
from a crush from summer camp.
You can't really see what the message is
because I wanted to respect their privacy.
So yeah it's a little distorted
but they're still on there.
The greatest part about this shirt though,
is the fact that this
is actually a romper.
This was my designer's idea, Angela.
So thank you so much for that.
So yeah we just wanted to create a piece
that was comfy and secure.
I love going out, so I wanted to make sure
that I had some pieces that I could wear
on like a night dancing
or out with the girls.
So here is the Wrap Tank.
This looks like a hot mess on the hanger.
But trust me when you put it on it's cute.
This is a ribbed tank that is fitted,
and it just wraps around the waist.
It definitely is a sexy
little number to rock
when you wanna bear some skin.
Next up I have the K-Tank.
There are just normal
spaghetti strap tops,
with a contrast trim
and a little Korean slogan in the middle.
The first one says (speaks Korean),
which means your mom in Korean.
Then I have fighting, which is
a phrase like you can do it.
And then I have (speaks Korean)
which means let's play or
like let's hang out in Korean.
These are really cute tanks
that you can wear on their own or layered.
Winter is coming, so
staying snuggly is a must.
That's why I made more long sleeves.
This is the O Dang long sleeve
and o dang means fish cake in Korean
so that's why there are fish
cakes where the nips are.
This comes in three colors,
this one is in a dusty blue,
the other is in a dusty maroon
and the last one is in a classic white.
Moving on to another graphic tee,
This is the nobody puts
Eggie in the corner.
Obviously this is a play on
"nobody puts baby in the corner"
but I just replaced Eggie.
This is in a really kind
of like metal band font,
because it kind of just reminds me
of all the metal bands that I
used to wear in high school.
Overall it's just a
very comfortable shirt,
that you can rock on casual days.
The last graphic tee that I
have is the Blur Baby top.
This is a cute crop top
that has the graphic Eggie in the front.
I just love the blur
effect because it's quirky,
and it just, I don't know,
makes it seem like time's
going by really fast.
I've always considered
graphic tops as a basic,
so that's why I wanted to add
more of them to my collection.
I consider polka dots a timeless trend,
so naturally I wanted to
add some into my collection.
This is called the Spot Top,
and it's just an off the shoulder blouse
with this gorgeous dot
pattern all over it.
It's got cutouts on the sleeves,
and it has a nice ruffle on
the shoulder and the ends.
This is really cute to wear
with high-waisted things
because it's so cropped,
and it's just like nice item to wear
when you wanna look all spruced up.
The other polka dotted item
is one that I'm wearing right now.
This is called the Dot Jumpsuit,
and this is a daring number
for those who just wanna strut their stuff
in a power jumpsuit.
I love that it elongates you
and it's just easy to
take it from day to night.
This is clearly one of my favorite pieces
because I'm rocking it right now.
I wore it with a long sleeve
just so it's warmer for the weather.
The sun keeps coming into my room,
so I've been like scooting
further and further back.
But basically, here is the next item.
So this comes in two pieces,
first I have the Connor top.
This is a strapless top with
this awesome contrast stitching
so that way it really pops.
It's got this cute ruffle detail
on the top and the bottom,
and this top coordinates
perfectly with the Connor pants.
These are definitely one of
the most comfortable pants
that I've ever worn.
They are very loose and baggy,
but fitted on the waist
so they look perfect with the top.
This set is named after Sarah Connor
who is probably like the
most badass woman in film.
So I wanted to just dedicate
a piece of clothing to her.
Here are some more trousers that I love.
These are called the Late Shift trouser,
and they come in two
colors, black and olive.
They kind of remind me of a work pant,
but way softer and definitely more chic.
They are also high-waisted
and the bottoms are
still baggy but not as baggy
but not as baggy as the Connor pant.
The highlight of these pants
are definitely the chain.
It's in this really awesome gold,
and it's quite substantial,
it's pretty heavy.
And if you like the chain,
you can move it on over to any
of the other pants in your closet.
As I mentioned before,
I'm having a huge moment
with red right now.
So here are the Bench Warmers.
They're these sick red joggers
with this white striping on the sides.
This is just a really nice tailored jogger
in a fun red print.
And I feel like they're a great way
to play with the sports lux
trend that's going on right now.
So we only have two more
items left in the haul
and they're both skirts.
Here is the Criss Cross skirt.
This is a tight black and red miniskirt
with this cross stitching on the side.
I feel like red and black
is such a classic color combination
and I just love how striking it comes off.
Alright the final item
is the Clueless skirt,
and I feel like this name
is pretty self-explanatory.
It's inspired by the 90s
classic film, Clueless.
And you can channel your
inner Cher with this skirt.
So that is a wrap on the haul,
please head over to Eggie.us
if you are interested
in any of the pieces.
Also I have a huge announcement
for the international Eggies out there.
I know shipping has been brutal,
I know some of you guys
have been paying 50 60 bucks
for shipping and I know
it's been unreasonable.
But I have been working
on this with my team,
to lower the cost and we
have finally succeeded.
So for most places it should be around
seven to 15 bucks for shipping now.
There are some places that are excluded,
they're still like 30 bucks.
But there's gonna be a
list, like a full list,
on eggie.us so please head
on over to the website
to see what your shipping costs are.
I've been getting so many
DMs and comments and messages
about this issue and so I've
been working on it so hard
and I'm so happy that it happened.
So thank you so much for you
know, voicing your concerns,
and I will do anything that I possibly can
to make your requests a reality.
I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching,
And I will see you guys in the next one.
Bye!
(blows kiss)
