what's up everyone November is over
which means that I'll be giving you a
rundown of the things that I loved last
month so let's get into it I was in
Southeast Asia for half of November and
I was under very humid circumstances and
so these are the products that really
helped a West Coast girl like me adapt
to the humid environment first I have
smash boxes primer I was going to a lot
of high pressure events and I feel like
this products is what saved my face from
looking like an oil spill
I put less than a dime sized amount on a
clean and moisturized face and then I
just apply makeup as I usually would I
think this is also a great product if
you want to skip foundation that day but
you want to keep your face from looking
too shiny dry shampoo is nice to have
but it is a must in humid conditions
especially if you want to avoid those
greasy strands in your hair and I
finally got to try out L'Oreal as fresh
dust dry shampoo and this was
recommended by my friend and hair
stylist Anna Lee and long story short I
was not disappointed it just does a
really great job soaking up all that oil
and leaves your hair looking volumize
fresh and clean also it's got a pleasant
scent to it so what more could you want
in a dry shampoo thank God my skin
didn't break out well as travelling
despite the different climate and
airplane cabin and I feel like my sk2
facial treatment essence had something
to do with it I'm using this product for
half a year now and I've been using it
every single day and I feel like my skin
has never looked or felt softer I apply
the essence after I've cleansed and
toned my face and I usually just put a
little amount on my palm and then I just
gently Pat it all over my face and even
down to my neck and this product has
anti-aging properties and it's just
really great for your skin you can use
it on a cotton pad but I personally
think you waste so much product when you
put it on a cotton pad I would rather
just skip the middleman and just put it
directly on my face and just a heads up
it is on the pricey side but I think
skin for me at least is something to
invest in because I'm stuck with this
for the rest of my life so I have to
make sure it's looking and feeling good
for my book recommendation I have
someone like you and know not a dull
song this is a collection of short
stories by one of my favorite authors
Roald Dahl and this is definitely not a
children's book though this is for
adults if you're into surreal
dark and disturbing stories and this is
definitely right up your alley and also
if you're tight on time and you don't
have the luxury to commit to a
full-blown 700 page adventure this might
be an option for you because they're all
quite short and it's a great way to
unplug so I treated myself this month
and splurged on some sunglasses they're
both cat eye frames and I love them
because they finally suit my face shape
first I have these gorgeous black cat
eye frames from House of Holland they go
with every single outfit and I love how
they add a chic and mysterious vibe to
any look and moving on to my favorite
pair of sunglasses these are my gold
glittery mew-mew sunglasses I went to
the store and I tried them on and there
was no going back I had to get them
they're definitely a showstopper every
time I wear them people like to
complement them which is definitely a
perk in my day
lastly I've got a lip favorite this is
Salem by Lime Crime and it's part of
their a Velveteen line and I had to get
this after I saw my best friend
Stephanie rockin on a couple of nights
out and I had to try it for myself and
this is just a great brown matte lip and
I love to pair it with a gold eye shadow
look it's very very matte and when it
dries to pop really then it will not
budge so you don't have to worry about
getting lipstick in your teeth or
rubbing it off because this sky is going
to stick on your lips for quite a while
and that concludes my November favorites
