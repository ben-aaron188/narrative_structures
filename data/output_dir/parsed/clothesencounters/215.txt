everyone welcome back today I'm doing a
clothing haul from all the damage I did
in Korea Seoul is exceptionally good for
shopping so I kind of went a little wild
there so this haul is gonna be a big one
the first store I'm gonna be talking
about is called a land if they have two
locations one is in Yangon one is in
Cadiz a year which is the one that I
went to and this place is just amazing
it's just filled rad stuff the one that
I want to have four stories I think or
even more but each level I was just
blown away my first item is this white
mesh top it's just really basic and it's
got this cool l'm a metallic square
right in the middle and even though it's
oversized since it's mesh my figure
doesn't get lost in it so you can see
exactly where my body is and just a
really great summer shirt because it's
got a lot of ventilation this whole
thing all the weight is going through
which is great you can never have too
many little black dresses this one is
really cool because it's quite casual a
little bit sporty I really enjoy the
little white piping on the sleeve of the
neck that that was a nice little touch
and this is just a really flattering
silhouette it's nice an a-line and it
just kind of flares out at the end and
it hits me at the perfect spot which is
mid thigh if you're short like me mid
thigh dresses and skirts that's like the
sweet spot the next item is just another
basic this is a striped shirt and I
don't know how many structures I have in
my closet by now I'm sure it's a lot
something quite boyish something very
comfortable to wear on casual days so I
went a little crazy with the headband I
was going to leave with five but I
narrowed it down to these three I got
this really cool leather one I'm pretty
sure it's pleather because it was quite
cheap but it's just got this really cool
bow where you can just kind of
manipulate the shape because it has a
wiring underneath my second one is a
little bit more just funky this has a
little bit of bananas on it it's got a
nice tropical feel to it and I show this
in Bonnaroo and I got a lot of
compliments on it surprisingly people
thought that there were little bunny
ears but uh no it's just a bow and the
last one is just a pinstripe one out
that this one was a little bit more just
polished and clean and this one is
actually not a headband it's like got a
little elastic on the side and actually
wish I got the one that was just as a
headband
guys this elastic thing kind of makes a
weird bump on the end but uh it'll do I
still think it's great the next batch of
items comes from Stalin Ando which is
hands-down my favorite store in Korea if
you go to Korea make sure you go to
their flagship store in Hongdae it is
totally worth the find they carry a lot
of stuff there they even carry Jeffrey
Campbell's and just a wide range of
styles for everybody there's something
for everybody in that store just a
warning most of the clothes are free
size which means one size fits all which
is not the case most of the times but I
mean the clothes are so cute that when
you find an item and even if it's a
little bit oversized or a little bit
tight you just have to have a Tim Gunn
moment and make it work I'm gonna kick
off the section with a white tee this is
oversized it's huge and it has the risk
of looking sloppy but all you gotta do
is roll up the sleeves and do a little
half tug you can add some accessories
along so you can like kind of weigh down
the fabric this is just also I just I've
been really enjoying just being as
comfortable as possible when I saw this
top I immediately thought of Mean Girls
because Katy is part of the mathletes
this shirt also came in white but I just
went oh my god and went for the pink one
because why not summer and I felt like
this is very fitting for it and this is
the type of shirt that just feels really
good so you are gonna end up sleeping it
and then just wearing it out to brunch
going off with that little math vibe we
are going to talk about these shorts
look how cute these little running
shorts are they have a bunch of math
equations on it like graphs and it's
really funny because I got all this math
stuff even though math was not my forte
in school like I dealt with it I passed
all my math classes but it was
definitely a struggle and I'm just
wearing all these clothes with math
stuff on it I've always loved the look
of an oversized button down especially
in dress form I found this one this is
pretty big but I just make it work by
adding a huge statement necklace and I
love that has pockets in it too you
don't see that very often but I can put
your keys in here or I don't know a
ballet ticket just whatever or just your
hands no summer wardrobe is complete
without a tropical print here I have a
cute printed bodycon dress that
screams vacation and holiday all of that
it's very bold and unapologetic and it's
also made out of a stretchy material so
when you wear it it's got a bit of give
to it I don't really have a lot of maxi
dresses so I thought I'd change that so
I'm adding this one into my arsenal this
is just a really cool Olive tank maxi
dress it kind of hits at mid-calf is
that I think that still counts as a maxi
is totally fine this is definitely a
really great summer dress that you can
just kind of float about in I've added
another little black dress into my
closet this one is different though this
one has really adorable pleading from
this little cute sweetheart neckline all
the way to the end I just think it's
really precious and I felt like this is
very versatile you can wear this is
somewhere that is formal but you don't
want to like show anything it's very
covered up modest but you're still quite
stylish as well nothing to eyes
sometimes I get a little tired of just
wearing the usual skinny jeans or even
the mom jeans boyfriend jeans sometimes
I just want a big wide leg trouser and
that's exactly what I got these are a
pair of cream wise like trousers my last
item from Sean and ahh is this gorgeous
white bomber it's this beautiful satin /
silky material it just feels so
luxurious I love it and I have such a
love and hate relationship with wearing
white pieces because I love the way they
look but they're just so damn hard to
keep clean like I already have a little
mark here
I've even worn this yet but there's this
weird beige oh my gosh it's actually
might be for my lipstick the last few
pieces are from just random stores and
home day it's really difficult to tell
you exactly which one it is because when
you go there it's just endless rows and
rows and rows of just sick clothes
you're definitely gonna find something
I've always loved making something quite
masculine into something very feminine
it actually plays off that whole trend
where you wear like a man's button-up as
a skirt but instead of having you do the
DIY thing they just made it into an
actual skirt which I I'm not complaining
about it and they actually made it into
a pair of shorts which I thought was
awesome I just think it's a really cute
playful piece and you're definitely
going to see it
future lookbook I'm gonna finish off my
haul with my favorite piece that I got
in Korea and it's actually pretty ironic
because it's a bomber that says Japan on
the back I mean I would have gotten to
one that says Korea on the back but
whether there wasn't one I got this at a
vintage shop so this was the only option
to get if there is one that does curry
on it I would have gone in a heartbeat
but there's only this one and this one
is just so sick to me it's flaming red
it's got Tigers on the chest dragon on
the sleeves and a big tiger on a meadow
just roaring with the crown it's just a
lot of look and I'm loving every second
of it this is the bold statement piece
that I have been craving for this has
definitely filled that void in my heart
I love it so those are the fashion bits
I got in Korea stay tuned because the
next video or movie the next video after
that it's gonna be the creating beauty
things that I got so that should be
really interesting if you enjoyed this
haul please give it a thumbs up and mean
a lot to me and yeah I guess I'll see
you in my next video which will be my
favorites probably and then it'll be the
Korean beauty cosmetic haul well thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one bye
