hey guys welcome to the first day of the
April vlog I am still in New York and I
am in a new hotel this morning I
transferred from the dream midtown to
the dream hotel in downtown and this
hotel let me say is very very nice
I finished my gig a couple days ago so
that's why they moved me downtown so I
can do the beautycon slash Westfield
meet-and-greet things I'm doing today
thank you to everyone that came out to
the event thank you so much we actually
got through everyone in the entire line
so every time that happens like it makes
me feel so good and I I'm sorry I got a
little rushed towards the end but we
just want to make sure that everyone was
able to take a photo and at least get a
hug I am so happy I feel I do feel
drained only because it's just a lot of
stimulation all at once but it's like a
good type of exhaustion like I feel like
I definitely feel elated and I'm so
happy that I got to meet you guys and
hear your stories so right now I'm just
in the green room just kind of resting
and then we're going to do a couple of
clips for the Westfield Mall Instagram
thing
good morning it is Sunday Sunday we're
about to get our first tattoos that's my
brother moment I think it's a good
decision you know get away with London
mm-hmm that's how they say it Yolo Yolo
exactly we're actually getting yellow
tattoos on her next yeah
so there are three different sizes
select the size we're gonna see how is
what our body its Jenny first tattoo
looking good
Evan is doing Jani first kryolan up
totally fine Miami on Attila 110 what is
paid like regular a coup okay Wow okay
I don't know she's just trying to be
strong for me having her first tattoo
happy no big body you're done you're
done
how do you feel good I'm hungover
we got just a room-service
lovely snack some garlic fries and some
shrimp cocktail this is a random choice
but I never regret any shrimp cocktail
never ever ever having dinner with it
looks like right through here right now
go back in the hotel room Danny's in the
corner recharging
she is my new roommate for tonight my
bunkmate we just got back from Korean
barbecue and now we're going to have
dessert these are cupcakes and they're
so tiny and small and they're by a
subscriber thank you so much for
bringing them the other day about to
have a little bite which ones which one
you want you pick first
anyway I want to get this freaking Oreo
one I'm gonna try the green one do you
think it is he was our first tattoos
today and he thought yeah ten level two
pain level two I was a pain level six
dude the delay the most awkward place to
show by two
uh okay so I am back in the hotel and
Danny left to go back to Toronto I'm so
sad I'm having daddy withdrawals it's
been so amazing getting to hang out with
her Lee I just learn to sit down and
talk about the tattoo that I got it's
really so awkward to show but I got
attached you this is my first one the
meaning behind it is self-love this is
just like your classic heart tattoo with
the banner usually says mom or dad but
this one says me and I love the fact
that we all got at me Danny and Eugenie
I've known them for quite a number of
years now me and Danny go way back since
2011 I would say and then me and Eugenie
probably the same so now that I got my
first tattoo I feel like you know I got
a couple more in the works but last
night my mom texted me and it's like the
saddest thing she says toyou NJ Totowa
could you go talk to Annie no more
tattoo please okay she's like genuinely
concerned about me and just so worried
so to call her and like calm her down
this will be the only tattoo for now mom
Ashley my manager is going to fly in
tonight so she'll be staying with me and
then tomorrow I'll be on set all day got
a lot of work cut out for me but for now
I'm going to focus on getting this video
what's up guys currently on the road is
Tuesday even though it feels like a
Monday yesterday we got back from
Coachella it was it was not it did not
disappoint that's all I'm going to say
I'm feeling a little I don't know I
guess I'm just feeling a little
melancholy now that everything is over
the festivals over or about reality not
that reality is bad but when you're out
in Coachella it's truly a magical place
like the only stretch you have is who
you're going to be next but we're going
to eat or what you drink later
that's it I am like a extroverted
introvert so I do have introverted
tendencies but I do well in social
crowds but after a couple of days of
being constantly being around people I
need my alone time to recharge and
center myself so that's just kind of
where my space is that right now I'm
just getting kind of acclimated to my
life again right now I'm heading to an
addressee she's going to do my base it
can be still nice is here I got her a
bag of goodies we got a bunch of stuff
at Coachella a lot of hair products so I
knew that she would want to try some all
right so the base is finished and it's
about to do a kind of like a beachy
effortless wave that's what she's known
for yours right yeah air dry something
simple look at all these nice air plants
in the home it's so beautiful you see it
you see it you see it five pumps of
cleansing conditioner and I'm mixing it
with where we're seeing Cristobal watch
pop up it's very weightless yeah doesn't
weigh down your hair at all no okay
one two three four five yeah
Oh two facing fish after the ends really
working so that's where it needs it the
most
oh you'll see
all righty you're here in LA live
yes we are we are going to see the show
absolutely okay I do
just like on a circus today oh yeah hi
here it's a little bit of relax
but it's like the number one selling
show in Las Vegas secure doll I hate
this is yeah look i regurgitating the
fact on the trash can
cheap yeah a very good job oh my God
look who got a haircut
oh she's in a very playful mood right
now she wants to play fetch or something
huh what's this what's this whoa whoa ha
right now I'm just getting ready to go
to the gym now that I'm home for a bit I
just want to get back to my normal
routine again I want just a general
couple days ago if that's going to be
good about that but I still would have
maintained my health game I tend to be
happier when I go to the gym more and
I'm not sure if it's correlated by the
fact that I feel happy that I went to
the gym or fixed like a actual slope
endorphins in my brain either way I'm
needed at the gym yesterday is bed and
make this amazing breaded chicken for
dinner I also have it for lunch and a
little just to get easy so just want to
I don't know I'll put those car keys
good morning learning the grandeur on
the road about to have a lovely brunch

brunch it is breakfast yeah because

to a studio to film a three-part series
with NBC for the Olympics
ah today I'm interviewing 16 future
Olympians or potential abuse if you
didn't know next year the Olympics will
be held in South Korea in Co Chun and
it's crazy because last I was in Korea

Chang and it's just such a beautiful
part of South Korea there's mountains

weather and the winter apparently

updates while I arrived
so we finished our first round of
athletes got the majority of the women's
hockey team cool and they did the
current false section we had like 10
statements about the beauty mystery and
then I figure out whether it's true or
false but now doing the next section
which is called plates the face kind of
like pin the challenge on e but with
makeup products so I've got the e
cushion on the cheeks because the
integrity have to be a little crazy to
do go to the cheek and in fact some
eyeliner a little a nice natural cat eye
and now I'm drawing in the lipstick just
the example version focus obviously you
get off blindfolded so you're a big
advantage
