hi everyone its strength I know many of
you guys have already started University
or you're about to start University so I
thought it'd be time to let you guys
know the ten things I learned in college
I graduated last June with a bachelor's
degree in communication at UC Davis I
was a transfer student which means that
I spent two years at a community college
and then finished off the rest of my two
years at a university so with that being
said let's get on with it go to your
counselor I don't care if the
appointments are booked back-to-back you
go drop in on office hours just be a
pest
your counselor is going to be the person
that sets up a road map for you so you
know exactly what you need to do in
order to transfer or graduate I had to
recommend seeing your counselor at least
twice in your academic career to make
sure that he or she hasn't grazed on
over any details don't be scared to sit
in the front of the class it makes it
less tempting to goof off or gossip with
your friend or fall asleep because the
professor's standing right in front of
you it forces you to listen to the
lecture and just absorb what's going on
in class turn your complaints into a
productive question we've all had that
class with that crappy professor who's
completely incompetent and sure it feels
good to kind of vent it out with your
friends and your classmates but it's
totally unproductive if you're not doing
anything with that frustration type out
and pinpoint exactly what doesn't make
sense to you it's okay if the question
is really broad just make sure you
refine it because in mourning exactly
what you don't understand is going to
help you move out of that black hole
you're in and make the class a lot more
understandable remember your professor
is a human being and he or she can't
read your mind so you have to ask the
questions right in your book I know
textbooks are very very costly and
pretty much an investment but what's the
point in paying two dollars for that
book if you got a D in the class so what
works for me is I have to physically
write in the book so let's say I see a
paragraph
I'll draw a line and then I'll condense
the information and just write a short
summary about it even if it's just a few
bullet points on what happens these
little notes are going to help you kind
of organize the information and just
retain a lot more because you're
interacting with the text as opposed to
just passively glossing over the words
after doing this method I found that my
reading comprehension just shot up and
my grades really improved because I was
challenging myself to see if I actually
understood what I was reading take large
projects and divide them into smaller
tasks once you hit your upper division
units a lot of professors they don't
assign busy work you're not going to get
something to turn every day most likely
you're going to have two or three
projects or exams that are going to
define your grade so a lot of projects
can seem very daunting and just really
overwhelming in my junior year of
college I had the stats class and our
grade revolved around one huge solo
project that project gave me so much
anxiety that I'd use that energy to work
on that project day by day or else I
just felt physically uncomfortable and
that last tip kind of bleeds into this
one which is make to-do lists so let's
say the professor assigns me a twenty
page research paper all with legit
sources and perfect grammar and etc how
am I going to do this one day I'll
assign myself to find six to ten just
legit credible sources and that's it I
don't even read it just find the sources
and just call it a day the next day I'll
actually read maybe two or three of them
to see if there's any information in
there that I can use for my paper and
the next day I'll read some more and the
next day I'll comb through some facts
just taking this day by day and making
little to-do lists either on your phone
or just on a planner or something
whatever works for you is going to help
you really break down these huge
projects go to class I know it's so
tempting to just stay in your warm bed
and watch Netflix all day eating Cheetos
making some rum and just go to class
because what fueled me to get out of bed
was no
that I was paying thousands of dollars
to learn something learning to deal with
homesickness when I first trusted Davis
I really struggled with ping homesick
for the first three months I was fine
because everything was just new and
sparkly and fun but after that three
months kind of passed I felt really
really depressed and what made it worse
was when I went to my original home like
my parents house where I grew up that
didn't feel like home either it just
felt both like familiar and foreign at
the same time and so I was just in this
weird limbo zone I'd say watch cartoons
day to know exactly what I'm talking
about I couldn't tell you what helped me
get past the feeling of homesick other
than just waiting it out just know that
a lot of you a lot of us have felt this
way too and just hang in there know what
environment works best for you
when I was working at home in my
darkroom in Davis I got nothing done
literally I just would go on tumblr or
YouTube all day and just scroll and
watch stuff it was just a time vampire
in my room I thought oh I don't wanna
talk about it
I found my favorite place study which
was the shield's library on the second
floor because that room was massive
brightly lit and I was just surrounded
by other people who were studying to
which kind of encouraged me to keep on
going so find a place that really gets
you in the zone and stick to that your
grades do not define you as a person
growing up grades felt like a huge
reflection of my own self-worth and if I
had bad grades I would see myself as a
bad person and that's definitely not the
case it was probably because I was
raised with the constant pressure to do
well in school and if I didn't I just
felt really shitty about myself I was
really really hard on myself to get good
grades and that
sure actually crippled me from getting
the crepe that I wanted this lesson hit
me when I was a senior in college and
this is when my grades shot up because I
just didn't give up anymore I went to
class wanting to learn something as
opposed to just try to remember exactly
what the professor said wondering what's
gonna be on the exam I was just a lot
less anxious and I was actually happy to
go to class and that's when I started
really really absorbing information and
just participating in class I was just a
lot less anxious and so much happier
after I learned to let go you're going
to learn a lot in college about the
world about other people about yourself
and you're gonna probably hit the lowest
of your lows in college and you're gonna
bawl your eyes out but you're also gonna
have a freedom blast it's a trade-off
and it's totally worth it and it doesn't
matter where you get accepted to where
you got rejected because college is what
you make it you can go to an Ivy League
school and learn nothing because you
didn't want to learn anything know that
every college experience is different
some of these tips may not help you or
some of them might be common sense but
for a lot of people common sense isn't
very common and these tips I had no idea
so I wish someone told me this when I
was going to college I'm also going to
do a college Q&A video in case I skipped
on over some questions or I didn't talk
about the subject that you wanted me to
elaborate on so leave me a comment with
your question if you can please be
concise and if you have an Instagram my
surname is I'm genom this is also the
handle for my Twitter as well in case
you want to tweet me I'll see you guys
in the next one bye
