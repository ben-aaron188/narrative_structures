hey everyone it's your girl Jen and I'm
sure a lot of you guys are curious as to
what this title is well I have partnered
with revolve to create the ultimate
festival beauty box and it's called Jet
Set John so here is the box and all of
its glory I freaking love the packaging
in this box there are a slew of high
quality products that I absolutely love
and I think our festival or travel must
have this is a hefty little box so let's
open it and see what's inside so the
first item in the box is the Genesis cow
eyes shadow palette this is the
collaboration I did with colour-pop
they're back only for the time being and
they're only available in this box and
there's four killer shades inside the
first one is this shimmery champagne
color that goes all of the lid or the
inner corners the second shade is my
perfect go to blending shades I
absolutely love it the third is this
nice deep brick red that makes your eyes
look very very striking and the fourth
is this dark chocolate brown that's
perfect for intensifying the eyes I'm
currently wearing all the colors on my
eyes right now and I feel like this look
is perfect for any music festival that
you'll be heading out - I'm definitely a
falsies type of girl and inside the box
I've got this parent from velour I
really like how there's they're there
you can tell those eyelashes on but
they're not too dramatic this is more of
like an everyday or like a bumped up
everyday type the lash and I think
they're perfect for music festivals
personally I love having falsies on as
opposed to lash extension I just had a
bad experience with lash extensions it
involved a thigh I liked I would become
like this side Queen so I just preferred
a falsies on because that's the end of
the day so rib mop and then you can just
rub your eyes and be free I cannot live
without dry shampoo and inside the box
we've got my favorite brand
this is Arcos Death Valley dry shampoo
I've mentioned this in my favorites for
sure and also in my top 10 products for
hair and that's why I was so stoked that
I'll be able to get the full sized
bottle in this box this does an amazing
job absorbing any oil
in your hair and it doesn't leave a
white cast all you're going to do is
kind of section off your hair blast up
the roots and just kind of rub it in
with your fingertips and boom you've got
volume you got texture if you're just if
you just want some extra grit into your
hair this is great to do on day one that
way your hair just kind of like it's a
little bit more obedient it does what
you want it to
especially for braids so this is a
product that I've also incorporated in
my previous videos I've got the waves
hair oil and I love this because it
keeps my hair feeling smooth and
protected so what I'll do is I'll do one
pump onto the palms of my hand and then
I'll just kind of rub it onto the mid to
end shaft and I feel like it does a
great job just keeping everything frizz
free and as smooth as it possibly can
you can also apply this on towel dried
hair put a couple of pumps on your hand
and as it dries it's going to ask add a
heat protectant so that way you can just
go in with your hot tools and not worry
next up I've got this lip polish by the
French girl and this is a lovely lip
scrub made from sugar shea butter
coconut oil and the exfoliation keeps
your lips soft and hydrated and ready
for any lip color you're about to apply
when you're at festivals your lips just
endure a lot from the elements whether
it's crazy wind of the cold nights and
also like the scorching heat so this
polish is going to keep your lips
feeling kissable and comfortable I'm a
huge fan of multi-functioning products
which is why I am happy to announce that
I've got this RMS lip to cheek product
this is in a really fun punchy coral
shade and you can apply it onto the
cheeks as a cream blush and I like to
use my Beauty Blender because I just do
not trust my fingers it always goes on a
little too strong so with your Beauty
Blender just use the end and just kind
of bump it on there gradually this also
makes for a beautiful lip color you guys
know that I love anything coral anything
peachy and this gives a beautiful flush
to the cheeks in the lips also the
formula is nourishing and creamy so you
don't have to worry about like your lips
crumbling off so this box wouldn't be
complete without a highlighter and bam
I've got three in here in this Stila
palette this is their starlight
Starbright highlighting palette and
they've got three gorgeous shimmering
shades the first one is called transcend
this is a nice iridescent pink flush
lavender highlighter the second is
called kitten and this is one of their
most iconic shades I'm wearing it on my
cheeks right now and I think it's
perfect it's shimmery it's like a
shimmery nude it's great and the third
one is called bronze this is just great
if you want like a sunkissed Chloe look
it goes on the skin so beautifully and
it's going to give you that gorgeous
dewy finish whenever I'm traveling I
love when things are travel sized one
because they're so functional and two
because they're so darn cute so inside
here I've got five products from Kai
this is an amazing brand it smells so
good it's like gardenia and white
flowers it smells really light and fresh
so you've got your shampoo and
conditioner so you're sorted for that
you've got your body wash and body
lotion so you're cleansed and
moisturized and the last one is like a
like a linen wash so in case like you
soil something or soil a garment you can
wash it and it all goes into this nice
little hemp case and you throw in your
bag and you're good to go
all right guys so that's what's inside
my jet set gen slash revolved beauty box
but now I'm also going to show you some
outfits that I created at revolve so I'm
going to roll the lookbook now
