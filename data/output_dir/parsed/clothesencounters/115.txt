hey guys happy Tuesday I just got out of
the shower because I went to the gym
today
so I'm feeling pretty good I wanted to
let you guys know that I filmed a video
with kin it's called home is and it's
basically me talking about what ho means
to me talking about my childhood by
upbringing so if you guys are interested
in watching that feel free to click here
or click the description box I'll leave
the link down there too today is pretty
jam-packed I'm shooting with my friend
Silas who owns the brand team cozy so
I'm going to be rocking a bunch of his
stuff I got to eat this pretty fast cuz
I got to get ready I'm starting from
scratch wet hair and everything so I'm
going to eat this as fast as I can
alright so here we are at location we
are shooting at the Walt Disney Concert
Hall we always like to go to the back
because that's where all the beautiful
misses or sculptures I see a lot of
people getting their engagement pictures
here so
I pledge to every citizen of our land
then I will be President for all
Americans morning today is a bizarre and
devastating day
it looks like Trump is the President of
the United States I know I never talk
about politics on my channel I never
talk about my spiritual beliefs but I
thought that I should say something
about this at least I feel like this
election has been kind of a wake-up call
for me if I'm going to be completely
truthful I haven't been very involved in
watching this political space with all
the elections like it just follows a
clown show and obviously I didn't want
Trump to win but I mean it wasn't enough
for me to go out and register to vote
and I'm really embarrassed to say that
but for those who didn't vote like me
but are not happy with the results this
is a wake up call for us we can't
continue to be apathetic with what's
going on in the political space because
four years is a long time I'm just
filming this so I don't forget how I
felt I'm telling you guys so you guys
can keep me accountable
I guess my excuse was that I knew that
California was gonna be a Democrat
anyway like we always are we always vote
left so I knew that our state was good
but what if I was living in Florida or
another swing state but I shouldn't do
all these water situations because
that's not the point the point is that
if you didn't vote this year and you're
unhappy with the way things came out
gotta remember this feeling and we got a
foe in the next four years so despite
all the drama that's going on I still to
get ready for my day I know a lot of
activities feel a little secondary
especially after the news but the show
must go on
I have a shoot with quorum which is an
asian-american publication I'm going to
be in their December issue so very
excited about that I'll let you know how
that goes
what's up guys here I am at the line
hotel I'm doing my core shoot this is
one of the first looks we're doing for

interview throw off to a good start

uploaded the first episode of Jen member
on the channel feeling good my mom has
the day off of work today because it's
Veterans Day so I'm gonna go hang out
with her
bring cheeky with me so Oh he'd take
cheeky on her first walk actually that
should be really exciting check out that
lens flare on the corner okay first off
I know I should get cheeky a car seat
that's the next thing I need to do I
don't know why I'm worried Stan vampy
look just to see my parents
it was supposed to just be like a what's
a call just like a fresh face do we look
and then what I thought was just gonna
be like a nude is actually like a dark
brown we see yeah it's like a dark mauve
but I like it
I think it looks good just not what I
was expecting
also for those were wondering what's on
my nails I really wish I had like a
specific nail varnish that I could tell
you I actually got this done at a salon
and they used this really cool like
chrome dust thing and they applied it
that way so I have no idea what color it
is made it to my parents house got my
big bro James in the mix this is what is
for dinner we've got Volcom Tong and
then this is kimchi coupe so just kimchi
soup keV okay Samira so what is Megan I
don't know
I'd like one out yesterday so I'm just
kind of in the mood to chill but I feel
like because it's Friday I feel like you
need to do something yeah I guess like
obligation you go
Wow right I want to feel that way huh
yeah like today I don't get I don't even
care I just want to stay home touch girl
that's like I'm vlogging I feel like I
should do something mildly entertaining
as well but I mean I know you guys don't
care I know if I just say no one would
care mmm
like you Wow you see this in computers
mmm can she cook little Shauna you know
what I feel and the batter hmm
I'm cheeky you enjoying your walk Oh
Ilana Roger boom-boom chicky-chicky back
at home now it was so awesome getting to
see my mom my brother and it was so
great walking cheeky Bennett first time
she was such a good girl it's so cute
seeing how unsure she was about
different services like the grass walked
for at least a good like mile over a
mile and she wouldn't pee or poo and I
think it's because she's not used to
being outside yet so right when we got
back indoors
Chiqui peed and pooed on my mom's floor
so that kind of sucked we're gonna
figure it out though I mean I think it's
because she's only known how to use this
pee pad in this specific area she
doesn't know how to use the pee pad at
my parents house yet
so we'll get there she's only a pup it's
8 o'clock
I'm just transcribing Jen van bar
episode 1 I feel like I always do this
whenever I feel kind of restless but I
wanna I don't want to work but I don't
want to do nothing so I just end up
writing captions for my videos which i
think is no no no is it
counterproductive I don't know what is
that I wouldn't even turn on the
subtitles or YouTube if you do let me
know write in the comments down makes it
unconstitutional for someone to be held
as this
Wow there are protesters outside my
building this is insane it's for the
anti Donald Trump protest going on and
yesterday I saw this documentary called
the 13th and it basically describes how
slavery still exists today but through
the prison system and it's being
protected by the Thirteenth Amendment if
you haven't seen this documentary on
Netflix you have to because this is my
first time hearing about something like
this and I am sure a lot of people are
in the dark like I am I feel like it's
so relevant to watch it especially at a
critical time like this once again I
didn't think I was going to get so
political but I mean there's stuff
happening right outside my window and
it's it's not right not to make any
commentary about it and I'm so proud of
these people walking on the streets
guys this is the Donald Trump protest
and it's growing my store for burger I
think we're walking to City Hall
Chiqui and i are out on the road that
protest was amazing that entire time I
was walking I had freaking chills we're
going to the pet shop to get her groomed
and we'll see how she turns out okay
this is chi-chi's before oh my gosh
Kiki sit this is not a treat giant bulla
okay so this is chicky after she's been
to the groomer this is a full body turn
oh my God look how tiny she actually is
my little rat okay girl not much going
on today other than editing the last
night was so much fun I really got to
catch up with some core people in my
life for her sakauchi Brianne she I've
known her since first grade and we went
to school up until I transferred to UC
Davis so we go way back an ostrich farms
was delicious highly highly recommend
you go there and then after I met up
with Claire and stuff and we basically
hung out in her new loft and we just
talked for a solid four hours and it was
just amazing getting a catch up those
types of friends are ones that when you
see them it's like nothing has changed
and I think that's what true friendship
is it's not like always feeling heckled
to text em see if they're all right it's
just a common understanding that like
I'm here for you whenever you need me
and when we do get together it's just an
amazing bond I had a really good weekend
I think it's important that I know how
to spend my time without them as well I
was proactive and made my own plans I
reached out to people it was a good
feeling very rewarding but today a day
of isolation I'm just gonna edit and
excited I'm like I don't know I can love
working this is a good outlet for me but
yes I want to thank you guys so much for
