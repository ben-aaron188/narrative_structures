hey everyone welcome to the first
favorites of the month January was a
really tough month for me because of all
the change and traveling and the move
but I'm so happy that it's winding down
and I thought I would do some shoutouts
the things that made my January a lot
more bearable so let's get started one
of the gifts that my boyfriend got me
for Christmas was this planner and prior
to this I was using this really ratty
notebook where I would manually write
down the day and the time the things I
had to do that day but now that I have
this gorgeous notebook I can really have
my life a lot more organized and
concrete I'm the type of person that
needs an itinerary or else I'll just
break down I get a lot of comfort
knowing that I can just look back to a
notebook and see exactly what I have to
do that day I was in the market for a
smaller backpack and this thin one from
de Lila totally completed that void this
thing looks thin that is very deceptive
because this backpack can hold so much
things like when I was in Tokyo I found
out that I was able to put my entire
DSLR including the lens into the
backpack and I thought that was pretty
impressive
so this backpack has been the perfect
size to just chuck in all my things and
my favorite part about this backpack is
the compartment in the middle there's a
slit that opens and you can put things
that you need really fast like a hotel
room key or a public trans ticket or
something something that you're gonna
have to constantly you know put in and
out of and it's just made my life a lot
more efficient and just easier I love
Clare that I've been loving has been
this room for makeup forever it glides
on really smooth and it's really
shimmery and a little frosty I've been
attending a ton of meetings and events
so this has been the perfect lipstick to
just slap on my face when I need that
extra move and since it's such a neutral
shade you don't really need a mirror to
look at it I mean this is something
where you can use your iPhone camera and
they'll be sufficient because although
precision is nice it isn't necessary for
this particular shade it's just a lot
more forgiving next up I've got some
makeup wipes from skin-food
and brown rice oil is the focus
ingredient and this has been amazing to
use while traveling because when I
travel I like to have no makeup on my
face so this has been a really good wipe
to just clean off my face and
she usually does the trick but everytime
I wipe it off I make sure to go in with
my regular facial cleanser to really
clean out all my pores because a wipe
doesn't do the trick you're gonna have
to go in with a double cleanse so I got
pretty sick while in Singapore and I'm
still recovering from my cold right now
and one thing that I was really angry
that I didn't pack was my Baraka and
since I've been home I've been taking
abraca every single day and I feel like
it's really sped up the recovery process
and Baraka is essentially the same thing
as emergency it's the say it's the
product that just dumps vitamin C into
your body and helps boost your immune
system
but I prefer the taste of broch a lot
better it comes in a little tablet and
you just put it in a really cool drink
or that's the way I like to do it I put
it in an ice cool drink and after it's
done fizzing you just chug it and it's a
little bit carbonated so it reminds me
of soda but it's not soda it's a vitamin
supplement so I personally like it plus
I think it gives me a boost of energy
which is always nice because I'm always
on that coffee grind so something that
gives me energy and has my vitamin C
supplements then I'm a happy girl so I
had gel nails for a couple of months it
was towards the end of 2014 the last
week of December I got them removed and
ever since then my nails have been so
thin and when I was in Tokyo literally
all my nails had ripped off like I have
real nails and they all cracked and
chipped and just fell and now I'm stuck
with these really short nails and when I
have short nails like to paint them nude
because I find that it just elongates
the fingers and my favorite nutrient has
been Zoya's Taylor it's like pretty
spot-on with my flesh color I like how
coordinated it is it's a really
versatile color that doesn't clash with
anything which is the point of nude and
honestly I really forgot how much I
enjoyed having shorter nails now when
I'm typing on my phone I can like feel
the screen and I'm tucking in my laptop
just feels like I'm chunking a lot
faster you know where my music favorite
I actually created a full-blown playlist
for you it is called new you so it
coordinates the new year and honestly
January was a huge month for me and
whenever I struggled to find motivation
for projects like unpacking things or
reorganizing something like my closet
music was the catalyst to get me moving
and get my blood pumping you know so I
created a playlist with all my favorite
upbeat bangers and honestly if you have
a project that you've been needing to do
just turn this playlist and hopefully it
gets you going because I don't know when
you have music in the background that
you like it just makes time go by a lot
faster and I think I'm gonna try and
make a playlist every single month that
coordinates so February should be a
bunch of live songs I'm already kind of
scared for March cuz I don't have a
theme for March but I'm sure I'll come
up with something then it's something
that's pretty ambitious for me but I'm
gonna try my best to keep my promise
alright so those are all my favorites
feel free to like this video and please
comment down below any video requests
you guys have obviously I know the
makeup tutorials are quite popular but
if you have anything outside of that
please let me know I have been in a
creative rut recently I think it's with
all the change and just having things
you I really enjoy having a rhythm and a
system but lately it's just something
that I don't have right now so anyway I
thought maybe I can seek some
inspiration from you guys if you guys
want to see something I'm gonna try my
best to make that happen I hope you guys
have a wonderful rest of your day and
I'll see you in next video bye
