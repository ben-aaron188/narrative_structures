everyone how's it going we'll come back
and as you can see my background is
completely different because this is my
new home in LA I've been to London which
is why I'm doing this hall I didn't get
too much out Topshop I just got a couple
of turtlenecks this is just a nice
striped one it's very fitted and I love
the thin stripes on it these kind of
tops are really versatile because I love
playing around with high waisted things
with this this is really great to wear
something quite baggy underneath as well
since it's so tight the second
turtleneck is just a simple black line a
black turtleneck is really easy to kind
of layer with necklaces and pair with
other block items I've just been really
enjoying cropped turtlenecks and I
thought I'd add another one to my
collection for the winter the first
purchase I'm going to show you that I
got from monkey is this gray top
it's a polo but it's cropped so it's
kind of a nice contrast between
something that is usually considered
really formal like you would wear a polo
golfing but since this is cropped it
really kind of makes it more street
style my next purchase for monkey is
just this oversized cardigan I love
cardigans that kind of go over your bum
so if you are gonna wear a crop top you
don't have to feel you know too
self-conscious about you know letting
your junk all out I also love that this
cardigan is in a nice ribbed texture so
that way if I do choose to wear an
all-black outfit the ribbon is kind of
breaks it apart moving right along
here I have another black and white
piece this is a striped sweater and this
is just a normal length sweater which is
nice and it's got these three white
stripes that continue from the sleeve
all the way to the middle to the other
sleeve I watched a lot of youtubers who
live in London and one store that they
always go to is called and other stories
and I was super excited to go in and I
was just ready to you know purchase
something but I think Boxing Day kind of
ruined it for me
because it was just frantic in there
everything was on sale and everything
was just kind of pulled apart and I
couldn't really find anything but I was
really I really wanted to leave with
something so I ended up leaving with
these really dainty hoop earrings
they're not like a showstopper they're
just some
that you would you know casually act to
your ear if you want a little bit more
gleam up in your face area I also got a
tangle teezer from and other stories but
I'm not going to show you that because I
brushed my hair with it and it's got all
these strands of hair on it and I don't
think that's very photogenic right now
I went to the rocket in Covent Garden
and I managed to get a couple of things
there
the first being this black rosette
sweater this rosette sweater is really
similar to the ones that American
Apparel does but I didn't have one in
black so I thought I would just go get
it it was originally priced didn't get a
massive deal on it but I was just stoked
to see it I also picked up a few
accessories there such as this beret and
you know me I love berets because they
just add a nice aggressive touch to an
outfit I also got these really beautiful
gold earrings they kind of look like
door knockers but a little less intense
these have cute little rhinestones on
the tip of each one so it adds a nice
little sparkle and overall I just love a
good chunky gold earring the next pieces
are from All Saints these are kind of a
Christmas gift to myself so I'm going to
show you the sweater what really sold me
was this nice terry cloth detail on the
front and the back
I like how they committed I'm
interpreting this as mountains or Joy
Division's
Unknown Pleasures album it's very
similar to that isn't it
I've always craved a really nice moto
jacket and I thought that I would
finally just splurge on one and just end
that craving and this one definitely
hits it because it is this gorgeous
leather and it's got this beautiful
shearing and it's kind of a shame
because I moved to LA and it's this
there's no place for this here which is
kind of upsetting but when I was in
London I wore the crap out of it I wore
it to Buckinghamshire which was really
cold for a Sunday roast so this is
pretty much like my winter coat the last
items aren't purchases they're actually
hand-me-downs from my boyfriend's closet
and I thought they were pretty good so I
thought I would share them with you one
is this nice Levi's flannel and I think
this is great to just layer over graphic
tees or on its own or even tied by the
waist it's just a piece that I can see
myself rocking all season
he also gave me his vintage Fred Perry
jacket he actually ordered this online
twice he actually returned the first one
because it was a little bit too small
and this one came and it was still too
small and so it's just been kind of you
know collecting dust in his closet and
so he let me have it because it fits me
perfectly when it gets really cool to
kids if it all the way up and it kind of
makes this nice muffler action thing I
don't know it's really great so those
are all the things I got in London I
hope you enjoyed it please comment down
below and let me know which one was your
favourite piece ll see you my next video
and I will talk to you later bye
