hey everyone it's a girl Jen and today
we are sending off the last month of
summer with a round of favorites and
personally I'm pretty excited to start
September and I will tell you why at the
end of this video but for now let's dive
into the favorites if you know me at all
you know that I have a very soft spot
for shoes and last month I introduced
these gorgeous mules into my shoe
collection and know some of you guys
might be looking at these mules thinking
that they're hideous but I think they
Rock they're from Jeffrey Campbell but I
got them at a website called Zhu Jie and
I've been looking for a pair of mules
with a platform because all the mules
that I have right now they're you don't
have one and they're a little bit
uncomfortable to walk in especially by
the third or fourth hour my feet are
usually suffering but with these I have
no problem with walking they're very
comfortable and are seamless with any
outfit because of the nude color it just
looks like an extension of your foot
which I love yeah expect to see these
mules in a lot more future look books
I'm a little bit of an organizational
freak because I love every item to have
its own specific home including my
jewelry and last month I finally put up
this really nice gold mirrored jewelry
display and it just showcases all my
favorite chokers and my dainty
accessories before I had this my chokers
are just kind of sprawled everywhere
they were getting tangled up I was
losing them and it just was not a good
system but now all my chokers have its
individual hook and I feel like it makes
a really beautiful decorative piece in
the room and I was wondering if you guys
would want me to film some sort of like
favorite jewelry haul tip a thing let me
know if you'd like to see that write in
the comments down below I always like to
keep my body hydrated and I've been
loving to use Danny's coconut hibiscus
lotion and this is actually my first
time ever hearing about this brand Danny
but I found it kind of randomly I was
shopping in his gift shop in turn eya
and they had a bunch of tester bottles
of this and - Lee I just like pumps them
on my hand thinking like oh I could use
some moisture once the scent hit I was
like oh my god I need to have this ocean
in my life because it smells so good it
smells like a really fancy pina colada
and I have a thing
for like tropical coconutty smells so
this is right up my alley this makes me
feel so calm I feel like aromatherapy is
a huge thing and I've noticed that after
the shower when I'm applying this my
mind feels at ease I'm just like in my
happy spot and my skin's super soft
afterwards there's also no crap in here
there's no sulfates there's no parabens
there's no sodium lauryl sulfate I don't
know what that is but it's not in here
so yeah check it out if you're a fan of
sweet smells and you want something good
for your skin I'd highly recommend this
so if you follow me on snapchat then you
all know that this is my laptop skin now
I had asked you guys on snapchat which
laptop skin I should pick and the
options were like the seafoam one this
grid one and then this blush marble and
this one won by a landslide and secretly
I was rooting for this one anyways so
I'm glad that we all saw eye to eye but
yeah they're from unique find and they
have a bunch of really trendy but
curated designs that you can just slap
onto your laptop just to be clear there
only a sticker so you're gonna have to
buy a separate clear case so your
laptop's nice and protected I thought
that I would just you know shout this
out because it's back-to-school season
and you want your laptops to look good
it's very rare that I read a nonfiction
book and I think it's because I just
really like getting lost in fantasy plot
lines but last month I read a book
called mindless eating by Brian Wansink
this is actually my friend Emily's book
I was just at her house and I saw this
book on her shelf and I was like oh I
should probably read that because I'm
really trying to amp my health game up I
work out regularly but what always sets
me back are like my food decisions and
it makes me so angry and I thought that
this book would help me and it actually
did it shows us how we eat more than we
think we do but it backs it up with case
studies experiments and facts I feel
like this book has helped me be more
mindful about the way I eat
for example now whenever I have a meal I
don't turn on YouTube I don't watch TV I
just focus on chewing the meal
thoroughly and enjoying it and I notice
that I've been getting full a lot faster
a lot of these tips in this book
are pretty common-sense like common diet
tips but
when it's attached to a case study it's
more sealing in your mind and you
remember more I definitely recommend
this book if you're interested in the
psychology of food and eating so my last
favorite is a tool that's been keeping
me a lot more productive meet the time
timer this is from Amazon and it looks
like a clock but it's actually a really
large timer I have been playing mental
games myself because I've noticed that
the most difficult part about finishing
a project is just simply starting it so
what I'll do is I'll grab this clear tab
and I'll put it to either 15 or 30
minutes and the rule is that no matter
what I have to work at the task at hand
until all this red is gone because when
the red is on I am not allowed to switch
different tabs I'm not allowed to just
paced back and forth and AH let it go to
the fridge or anything I have to do
whatever I said I would do and it does
take a little bit of discipline but just
having this time timer just keeps me a
lot more time efficient and it's been
helping me keep a lot more organized you
could also use this for other things
like chores for example let's say you
have like a really messy room or
something
you could put it you know just pull the
tabs ten minutes and just clean for ten
minutes and that 10 minutes goes a long
way this would also be an amazing study
tool as well I think so yeah check it
out want to be more productive alright
guys so that concludes my August
favorites as usual feel free to write
your favorites in the comments down
below I would love to read about them
and now I can finally tell you that I
will be vlogging every day in September
until my birthday it is going to be
called Ghent mber it doesn't really how
like a ring to it but it works it's fine
I just thought I would vlog because I
miss flogging actually I mean snapchats
fun but the fact that it disappears
makes me very upset especially if I put
so much work into it so I thought that
you know I would just vlog every day in
ember and upload it on YouTube I won't
be uploading every day I will be filming
every day so each episode will have
maybe like a compilation of three or
four days in it if that makes sense so
yeah stay tuned for that
