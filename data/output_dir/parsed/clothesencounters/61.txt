today is the first day of June so
welcome to the monthly vlog I'm wearing
a flutter because it's actually a pretty
gloomy day today June gloom is very real
but as you can see Ben and I are in our
new home he's cooking lunch over there
he's living Valen aids but unfortunately
I won't be able to eat that I'm heading
out to Venice today because I partnered
with Daniel Wellington so I'm going to
their store and Abbot Kinney to check
out their brand new collection let's
head on over alright so here is the
gorgeous Bondi collection
apparently Bondi is a beach in Australia
so I guess it's mean after that oh so it
comes in a rose gold any silver option
but I'm diggin the rose gold it's
absolutely stunning these bracelets you
could also purchase to layer with the
watch then watch base is 32 millimeters
so it's nice and petite and the straps
are also interchangeable so you can do
whatever kind of color that you'd like
so this is what the watch looks like on
as you can see the Rose Bowl really
complements everything it makes my skin
tone looks very tanned and perfect for
the summer II oh my gosh I love the way
it looks these days I just love wearing
watches because whenever I check the
time on my phone and I'm around someone
it's a little rude but with the watch it
can be a little bit more slick with it
and just kind of casually peek like that
if you are interested in grabbing your
own Daniel watch and watch I have a
promo code just use Jen 15 and get 15%
off your order also the couch has
arrived this is from West Elm and I
think cheeky approve more you think chip
Oh Ben and I could both easily
comfortably lay down here and watch the
TV eventually we'd like to get this
mounted maybe get a bigger TV and then
mounted on the wall but this is
definitely going to work for now and
then our coffee table is going to arrive
tomorrow whoo so
I've been sitting at the same spot for
the past two hours I believe I'm just
editing my main monthly vlog I want to
have this out by Sunday although I think
I might up this on Saturday because I'm
going cute don't go I'm so excited this

events and I just looked up for my
laptop and it's all starting to sink in
