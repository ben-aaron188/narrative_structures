hi I'm dren this is my very late 2012
favorites video I'm just going to
compile a bunch of my favorite products
from this year or last year okay let's
begin and we'll start off with my
favorite high-end foundation it's NARS
sheer glow it's something that I've been
consistently using on my face because I
found the perfect shade for my skin tone
I love NARS sheer glow because it's got
a very natural and dewy finish so it's
great if your skin's a little bit on the
dry side from under-eye circles I use
Maybelline's erase your dark circles and
I use this as an under-eye concealer as
well as concealer for spots
I mean I some people might find it
unhygenic but I mean I my skin doesn't
really break out that much this is
highly recommended all over YouTube so I
thought I would give a stab at it and I
love it let's move onto eyeshadows Naked
1 palette has served me very very well
if you're wondering what kind of
eyeshadows I use for my highlight brow
bone I use virgin and sometimes I'll tap
that in the inner corners of my eyes as
well and half-baked is really torn up
because this is probably the most color
that I use on the inner corners of my
eyes as well as all over the lid if I'm
feeling really golde that day and Dark
Horse is what I used to shade my brows
and if I want to intensify a look I just
use the trusty old creep for drugstore
my favorite eyeshadow is probably the
Maybelline Sun baked neutrals it's in
this really shoddy gross disgusting case
because I take really crappy care of my
makeup um anyway you can say that I've
used this bronzy gold color and this is
my go-to all over the lid color because
it's this gorgeous brown bronzy shade
and I use the dark brown right next to
it to kind of intensify the look and I
use this I guess tannish color to act as
a blending color when I'm trying to fade
it out for an eyeshadow base I love
using Maybelline's color tattoo this one
is in bold gold
apply this with my finger and just kind
of smear it all over the eyes and I find
that it makes my eyeshadows a lot more
vibrant and I use mostly warm tone
shades anyway on my lids so I find that
it just really enhances
color for eyelashes I am a devout
follower of Maybelline's the falsies and
this one's in black drama this mascara
is great if you have little to no
eyelashes and you want something that is
fairly cheap this is around nine dollars
at CVS this is a very buildable mascara
if you already have long lashes I
wouldn't recommend this because it gives
a very clumpy texture but but when
you're working too little to no lashes
it makes all the difference that you can
kind of work with the clumps and
personally I kind of like that spider
lash look yeah my blush I'm using NYX
illuminating bronzer and I don't know
who would use this as a bronzer because
it's this peachy shade with bold flecks
I think this is pretty much blush but
what do I know I don't know much about
makeup I find that this creates just a
beautiful healthy refreshing glow to my
face I just discovered the wonders of
blush probably February 2012 and I
realized that blush can make you look
from sickly patient to just a glowing
goddess I guess I don't really have a
very extensive skincare product list I
probably should but I don't really do
all that much to clean my face I use a V
nose clear complexion foaming cleanser I
love this formula because although it
comes out in a phone it doesn't lose its
consistency when you're rubbing it on
your face it holds its form and it feels
like you're actually washing your face
and not just splashing and smearing a
bunch of crappy little bubbles on your
face this really holds and I find that
it takes off all my makeup it's pretty
insane and it's been keeping my skin
quite clear and sometimes I'll use this
to wash my brushes for moisturizer I use
this giant tub of CeraVe I'm sorry about
taking off the label of this lotion
dryer never thought I would present it
to anybody but I took it off because I
just didn't like the way it looked it's
just this blue label and instead I just
attached this cat sticker that my
housemate gave me and although this
lotion is kind of thick in consistency
your skin just kind of sucks it up
moving on to nails I have been obsessed
with SCS absolutely short whenever I
don't know what color to paint my nails
I just kind of gravitate towards this
maybe because I have this strange love
affair with seafoam and I never finish
any nail color without Sally Hansen's
insta-dry anti
top coat this dries your meals within 30
seconds and then you can pretty much do
whatever you want after using this top
coat my nails just dry instantly so I'm
able to do whatever I can go type I can
go hold a pencil without you know
smearing my middle finger it just opens
the doors of a lot of things because
painting your nails is quite a time
commitment because you're going to put
the base then you got to put two coats
and then you know the top coat so this
one just kind of seals the deal and just
makes the process a lot more smooth my
favorite just go to shoe has been my
cleavers they they've molded into the
shape of my feet at this point if you
ever see me at school I'm probably
wearing my creepers because I'm just
kind of out the door with them on
they're really comfortable and plus I
think that I'm losing a little bit of
weight because they kind of act as
little weights on my feet so I'm
probably burning a few extra calories
because of these heavy shoes my favorite
summer shoe has got to being my nude
Gerdes and as you can see they're quite
dirty because I wore them a lot this
past summer I love the grades because
there were nutrients so it just kind of
elongated my legs and gave me the
illusion of tallness
my favorite black boot was my Maya
drivers guy just kind of pillaged them I
wore them so much that the heel kind of
detached from the wedge and it happened
at the most embarrassing place I was in
Berkeley I was walking and I felt like I
was losing my grip and I just found that
that the heel was breaking off and I
know it's a easy solution I could just
probably get some shoe blue and just
kind of smush it together but I feel
like I might retire them now because I
wore them so much maybe it's a sign that
I shouldn't wear them anymore my iPod
has now been broken for well over a year
now and I don't know I just don't buy
another one I've been listening to a
crap ton of podcasts my favorite the top
three are Radiolab I disgusted in my
September favorites you love has saved
me so much from the long drives back
from North Cal to So Cal it's around a
six-hour drive and I think and most of
the time I'm just listening to these
podcasts I'm pretty sure that I finished
almost every single one of them and if
you're looking for something that will
you know stimulate your mind and get
your mind off something else it I find
that it really helps and plus you learn
something really interesting about the
world number two is this American
This American Life just compiles a bunch
of new stories that are local and just
global and my third favorite is a Duncan
Trussell family are that's all I'm gonna
say about it but I find him very
interesting and if you are kind of in a
psychedelic mindset I suppose give him
listen he's really funny and I
personally love the sound of his voice
usually I listen to him when I'm doing
my makeup because he just had some
really far-out things my last favorite
is my sriracha bottle because it's been
through a lot this year or this or this
past year I've been doing a lot of self
cooking and in the beginning I was
absolutely horrible
so the sriracha sauce kind of made my
very very mediocre cooking into
something that was edible
okay I don't really have any fashion
favorites other than my beanie but I
just thought it'd be super redundant
plus I'm very sporadic about what I like
in fashion so I thought that obviously
wouldn't blink because I haven't been
very consistent with anything that I
truly like fashion wise I also want to
thank you for watching my videos very
very patient with me and I hope that
2013 is going to be even better than
this year if you have an Instagram my
