from my classic red I have dual ops
private red and it's really a little
lipstick it's like smaller than my index
finger and it actually came with the
sample set from Sephora but it's a
really nice deep red color and even
though it's not matte or anything it
stays on your lips for a really long
time even after eating and stuff and
it's just a really classic red color and
I wear a lot when I'm like going to
dinner with my boyfriend or whenever you
just need to pop it right on your lips
lately whenever I need like a lip color
on my lips I usually tend to go for
sephora's deck Cola and I think that's
already pronounced I'm not quite sure
but it's like this really gorgeous pinky
shade color and I think it just enhances
your lips and just brings out all the
color back to your face and I think it's
really feminine and I love to wear
especially on the daytime because it's
not too much color probably my favorite
lipstick in my whole collection is rose
Peto which is I guess it's French
spelling of petal and it's from Lancome
this was from our personal video like a
year ago and right now it's deteriorated
it's turned into like this little crater
of lipstick because like you said so
often it's a really creamy rosy blend
and I love it on my lips because it's
really natural looking and I also using
this blush too all the time it's like I
think in our crop top video that's what
makes me look glowy or someone's in it
in a comment but this is my favorite
lipstick and you could tell why because
like clearly I've been like scooping the
crap out of this but I'm just really sad
because I think this is just continued
this is max chilly and it's kind of like
this brownish brick-red which I really
love I think and it's matte and I love
matte lipsticks because I don't like to
like that really drying like texture on
my lips I don't know why I think I just
feel like um like Kristen Dunst in like
her Mew Mew campaign
because she has these really matte lips
it means they're just fell in love with
that look I think that's how I started
liking matte lipsticks I have this color
called on hold by Mac and it's kind of
like a bright pinkish rosy reddish color
and it's supposed to be my rose petal
part too because I really love that
color and I want to find the exact same
thing and it turns out this is nothing
like that it's a much deeper redder
pigment and it's much less natural but I
learned to love it in its own way this
is red lungs volcanic red and this is
like my go-to red lip color it's really
moisturizing which is cool and it's it's
really cheap it's like I don't know like
six six seven dollars I want to say and
this is more inge by Mac and it's super
bright it's super vibrant and on trend
right now and it's just if you wear all
black or all dark drab colors this is a
great way to like vamp it up not map it
up this is a great way to like energize
your outfit and make you not look like
you're trying to be a vampire or goth
next I hop is taupe and this is also my
super neutral shade it's kind of it's on
the brownish side this is the lipstick I
usually wear if I'm going to a little
bit more of like professional things
like if I like job interviews or if I'm
meeting like the parents or something I
like to put this on because I feel like
it really enhances my lip color but it's
it's just kind of like saturates to my
actual lip color and that's what I
really like about it this is a pretty
recent lipstick for me it's called
Jezebel by Lancome and it's a deep
reddish brown it's a really dark series
color when I wore it and I had my bangs
really short I felt a lot like like
Bettie Page and some we're like bondage
a pin-up girl or something but I
actually got this because I thought it
was my other Lancome color and
get up off the table and it's my mom's
that I've yet to give it back to her
but I like it a lot this is Vegas bull
it's what my favorite lipsticks it's
completely flat I don't know why but
it's it it's kind of like a toned down
version of more inge and it's got
lighter it's got more of like a pinkish
shape and orange but I love both
lipstick colors and I wear this on
nights out or if I'm like ham the girls
because they understand a bright lip
unlike most men this famous one is Yves
satirize black tulip and this is
discontinued as many people have told us
in our formspring after many other
people have asked us about it inform
spring and it's just this really deep
deep dark purple color almost black I
got it because I was always interested
in that whole black lipstick trend that
was about a year ago or so and I always
wanted one but this was the closest I
could get and I'm actually really glad I
didn't get a black lipstick and I got
this one instead because I think this is
more feminine and versatile and you
could just wear it with more things than
black because black is a really like set
look this is redline's siren and this is
a great dupe of Max Vegas bolt and it's
this awesome coral color and it's like
half the price of what you would pay on
a matte lipstick the only problem with
this is that it's a little less
saturated well it's a lot less actually
than biggest bullet and it comes off
pretty easily but I mean it's a quick
fix if you want that summer summery
orange lip and when I found out that the
YSL black tulip was discontinued I was
like oh crap I gotta find a new dark
purple lipstick or else I'm just not
gonna have in my collection cuz that's
gonna run out this substitute is Sephora
asthmatic net and it's the skinny little
thing which is kind of nice because it
makes your application more precise and
it's a nice matte lipstick the only
problem I had with the why I saw one was
that it wasn't mad
was really like shining and kind of like
slippery but this is nice and that one
the only thing is that it's not as deep
of color as the way I saw one but it
will do the job when the other one dies
this is wet and wild five two two a and
I could have sworn I thought this was
called dark berry but I guess not it's
called five two two a and it's like this
kind of like a like a dark like I don't
know it's like a plum color but a little
bit lighter and I want it darker or
sometimes I dab a little black eyeshadow
on my lips and then apply this over it
and just kind of make sure I really
blend it in and that's kind of like my
really cheap alternative to Sarah's
black tulip which I love
hey this is like seriously like mug
shots huh five to to a chick
