hi everyone it's me Jen and back with
another what would Jen wear episode it's
basically a series where you tweet me or
fashion dilemmas slash questions and I
answer them as best as I can so let's
get started the first tweet comes from
that's Jana and she asks how would you
style a loose gray top for fall I live
in Canada so it's pretty cold bunch of
turtle emojis I love styling grade tops
because it gives me a chance to really
break out my silver accessories I like
the way they look together because the
gray has a nice cool tone to it and so
it just flows with the silver really
well since you said it was chilly in
Canada I threw on this olive parka with
this gray faux fur collar and I actually
got this at the men's department saara
so and then just to streamline
everything I wore some black skinnies if
the holes are too much for you you can
wear ones that don't have any easy
next up Jessica Lee says to be honest
I'm really tired of the 90s trend can
you make an outfit with 60s inspiration
that you can wear to college so this is
an outfit that has a bunch of 60s
inspiration that you can technically
wear to college I mean not gonna lie
it's a little bit more dolled up but I
think it's great to wear on you know a
Thursday class for example so you can
just wear this to class and then go
straight to wherever you want to go so
the 60s inspiration definitely comes
from the top it's got this really crazy
psychedelic print to it and I added a
little newsboy cap and some thigh-high
boots for that perfect 60 silhouette
I've noticed that a common color palette
in the 60s was warm and muted which is
why I went for the brown suede skirt and
I know these boots look intimidating but
trust me the heel isn't high and they're
just quite comfortable just imagine
you're wearing more of a evolved form of
the thigh high sock Masha asks help Jen
how do I pull the large and comfy outfit
without looking like a homeless man love
your videos Winky I'm all about wearing
loose and comfy clothing too but if you
want to avoid looking like a frumpy
vagrant then the easiest way to do that
is to throw on some tall boots it
elevates your look and keeps an outfit
from looking too manly now if you're
already really tall and you don't feel
comfortable
we're in heels then you can just wear a
smart-looking flat like an Oxford or
just a nice pair of loafers although I
went baggy head-to-toe the look is still
polished because the little details in
my outfit like the dual sleeves in the
jacket and the cute trimming on the top
it's little details like this that are
gonna make your outfit from Street to
chic
moving right along I've got a tweet from
Irene and she asks what would Jen wear
with a long baseball jacket what do you
think about navy blue and black yay or
nay okay so to answer your last question
yes I think you can definitely pair
those three combinations together I know
it's in a lot of fashion don'ts like you
shouldn't combine those three colors
because they're just going to muddled up
but if you think it looks cool just do
it because chances are this color
palette is going to be on the runways
three or five years from now and you
couldn't be the one to say I wore it
first going back to your first question
this is how I'd style a long baseball
jacket I just wanted to go black and
white with this outfit and chose a comfy
striped sweater tunic because I wanted
to play up the clean and structured
lines in this look I did some floral
shorts in the mix in case you want to
save yourself from mooning anyone and
then I added a pop of color with these
velvet wine lace-up boots and plus I
think velvet is a really great texture
for the colder months next up not that
Kay asks what would Jen wear this
Halloween do be honest I'm not really
sure I'm not going to be the state's
this Halloween so that kind of you know
killed my Halloween spirit but on the
bright side I'll be in Singapore this
Halloween and there's also going to be a
meet and greet on Halloween so it's
pretty exciting more details on that
later but I want to ask you guys do you
Singaporeans celebrate Halloween as hard
as Americans do please comment down
below I would love to know Karen Wynne
asks I just got a sick pair of Jeffrey
Campbell heels I love them but don't
know how to style them in a casual
outfit help I have shoes that are very
very similar to these and I wear them
all the time especially in a casual
setting so this is how I'd style them up
I layered a crisp white button-down with
a chunky speckled cardigan and knits
instantly make any outfit look more cozy
and relaxed
so just throwing on and bam that's your
cute and comfy outfit that you can
easily wear during the day
the last tweet comes from the vamps
Valerie what to wear to the grocery
store something casual but not sloppy
I'm just going to the grocery store I
still make an effort to look nice
because I just really enjoy getting
ready
I think it's casual edgy and definitely
not sloppy I went for a cool layered
look with this extra long flannel and I
find that it really tones down this
black dress and makes it perfect for
everyday I added a few jewels to add
some Flair and then this bright neon
beanie to avoid getting run over in the
parking lot so that's it for this round
if you're looking for more brand new
episodes of three in it then you can
