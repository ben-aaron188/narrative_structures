hi you're watching 50 random facts about
me so let's begin with number one my
name is Jen M I'm pretty sure in 5-1 a
lot of you guys have that misconception
that I'm a tall person no I'm just
really blessed that I have a camera
woman who makes me look tall I'm a
California girl I was born and raised in
Southern California but two years ago I
moved up to Northern California for
school I honestly think that Northern
California and Southern California
should be two different states because
there are completely different cultures
I go to UC Davis and initially I didn't
like it but as of right now I'm really
sad to graduate I graduate in June
not sure if that counts as a fact but I
graduate in June and I don't know I
really enjoyed my experience here I'm
currently majoring in communication I'm
a transfer student so I've never
experienced dorm life right when I
transferred here I moved into an
apartment after I graduate I'm probably
going to move out to the bay because I
don't I honestly don't see myself living
in LA I really like it up in Northern
California and I remember I fell in love
with San Francisco when I was 17 or 18
years old I was on my first road trip
with my girlfriends and we went to visit
my friend John and I was just smitten
with the city it was the first time that
I was in an area where there was a
concentrated amount of artistic people
just public trans that actually
functioned cool architecture and just
the overall vibe of the city just blew
me away I after that trip I swore to
myself that I was gonna move there I had
a lot of weird nicknames growing up I
think the most popular one was Bruce Lee
because I had a bull haircut when I was
around 7 years old I don't know I think
it's kind of like a rite of passage if
you're an Asian kid you're going to have
a bull haircut
sometime in your life another nickname I
had was Toy Story because my Korean name
is PO yi so it kind of sounds like Toy
Story
I don't know these nicknames are all
given to me courtesy of my older brother
and yeah I have an older brother his
name is James and he's pretty incredible
I'm quite a saucy gal I love my ketchup
my barbecue sauce my ranch honey mustard
so rachis how can I forget that one if
there's
photobooth round me I will use it and
I'll probably drag you in there with me
because there's something about that old
school film strip that is really
romantic and interesting to me I love
cheese like I really really like cheese
my favorite is probably a French millet
or a black truffle Gouda I own way too
many shoes for one human being I'm kind
of afraid to film a shoe collection
because I don't want to confront the
number like the precise number of how
many shoes I own I remember getting my
first pair of glasses when I was in
third grade I have terrible vision I
wear contact lenses and I've never worn
circle lenses or colored contacts
because to be honest I don't think that
they make my prescription and these
other glasses that I wear right now I'm
wearing my contact lenses at the same
time so I literally can't see anything
this is probably making my vision even
worse but I want to show you guys what I
look like I drink my coffee black I
never add any sugar or cream to it in
fact I don't add sugar to cream in
anything because I I don't really have
that much of a sweet tooth
I'm definitely much more of a savory
person I would pick a bag of chips over
a doughnut any day my favorite chips are
anything from the flamin hot collection
but honestly the hot cheetos that are
the triple spicy have a very special
place in my heart I am 22 years old I'm
not 15 or 16 so yeah surprise that's how
old I am I have pretty bad hand-eye
coordination but I've been playing
kendama and I think it's kind of
changing that I'm obsessed with the
smell of laundry detergent I'm pretty
sure if you've been following my channel
for I don't know eight to nine months
you guys know that about me already but
that's why I buy things like downy
UNSTOPABLES or I'll buy the detergent
with the downy infused in it because I
just want to saturate all my clothes to
smell like one big laundromat I grew up
playing piano but I stopped at age
eleven because I was being a brat and I
was telling my mom that I want to do
this crap anymore and that was probably
one of my biggest regrets because now
I'm stuck with only two songs I know to
play the first song being Beethoven's
Fur Elise like I don't play the entire
song like they even the da da da da
like that entire part I know to play so
that's pretty impressive and the second
song is FX twins Alba 14th which I
taught myself on YouTube and that is a
beautiful song I can't submerge my head
fully underwater it's a phobia that I
got when I was younger because I hate
the feeling of water entering your ears
but it not escaping out properly so if
you ever seen me in a large body of
water I'm usually just donkey paddling I
love looking at old family albums
looking at my mom's old style my dad's
old style it's something that's really
nostalgic to me even though I wasn't
there
I just feel closer to them seeing what
they looked like when they're my age
whenever I go under tunnel I make a wish
but I always make that wish very
reasonable like I hope my friends and I
have a great day today or I hope my
package doesn't get lost in the mail
just very reasonable wishes that are
probably gonna happen anyway I'm told
that I'm a very enthusiastic person and
I don't know what to say to that other
than the fact that yeah I kept pretty
excited very easily whenever I paint my
nails they never match my toes I am an
apple not a PC unfortunately I really
appreciate handwritten things especially
on cards post cards little notes because
I think we're living in this electronic
age where we're constantly typing that
we never see someone's actual
handwriting so it's quite interesting to
see what it looks like I think
handwriting says something about the
person's character this is my
handwriting for those who are wondering
one of my all-time favorite fruits is
watermelon and I love it when it's cut
into symmetrical little cubes that I
could stab it with a fork or a toothpick
I've done my fair share of part-time
jobs I will start naming all my jobs I
guess I've worked at Baskin Robbins I
was a server at Johnny Rockets I worked
at a bakery I was a barista at Surf City
squeeze I was a sales associate at for
everyone my last part-time job was a
smoothie maker at this place called robe
X and now my job is making YouTube
videos and I hope that doesn't come off
as a big surprise to you because a lot
of popular youtubers their job is in
fact YouTube and to be honest YouTube is
definitely a full-time job
but luckily it's something that I really
enjoy doing so I don't mind that I'm
working more and I've never done because
is it's something I truly love doing I
think that's when you've figured out
your dream job I love when large bodies
of people congregate to one area for one
specific purpose like a music festival I
get like a physical high from being
around that many people I think it's
because when you're in a group like that
you really lose your sense of self and
you become part of this one collective
force so I don't know losing yourself
for a while is a bit fun and healthy for
you from time to time whenever I'm on a
plane I will order tomato juice because
it kind of tastes like cold tomato sauce
I work out and run only at night because
that's the only time I really have I
love writing and multi colored pens so
if you take a peek at my school notebook
it's all in colors it's like purple
orange blue it literally looks like a
fifth grader wrote it I am a hardcore
Napper I don't know I can sleep in a lot
of places that normal people can't sleep
like I can sleep in a public place like
a classroom especially a classroom I can
sleep on a bench
once my head hits my pillow I'm out like
a lamp and some people call it a gift
and I agree because sleep is very
precious
I love eating soggy food especially
soggy cereal and to be even more
specific I love soggy frosted flakes
because they turn into select salty wads
of sugar that just dissolve in your
mouth I think it's kind of due to the
fact that I'm sometimes I'm too lazy to
choose something I don't play video
games because I don't like to lose I'm
really OCD about dishwashing if there's
a dirty dish in the sink I will wash it
even if it's not mine I've been to
Burning Man twice and I would love to go
this year but unfortunately I couldn't
get a ticket
I'm extremely ticklish I can't get a
massage without laughing hysterically or
squirming or physically punching the
person that's tickling me
when I was 15 I braces my right canine
tooth kind of sunk in so it took 8
months for it to pop it out and I was
left with my teeth right now so those
are all my 50 facts I hope you guys feel
like you've got to know me a little bit
better I would love it if you would
comment down below and tell me one
interesting fact about you I would love
to read it seriously I would love to
read it if you haven't

than that I will see you guys next time
