hi guys it's a girl Jen and this is my
second video in collaboration with dari
and if you've seen my what's in my
bucket list video then you'll know that
I've been wanting to cook my family a
three-course dinner well guess what this
is the video where I show you how I
prepped and fed my family so let's get
started for my first course I'm going to
make a spruce top arugula salad and
here's what you're going to need I'm
going to start things off by prepping
the cherry tomatoes I'm going to take
the tops off and I'm going to cut them
in half once I'm done with that I'm
going to go ahead and start plating by
adding the arugula along with the
tomatoes and drizzle a bit of olive oil
and grate some Parmesan cheese halloumi
tastes the best when it serves straight
away so having everything else perhaps
saves you time and stress and if you're
not familiar with halloumi it's a Greek
cheese that you can usually find in like
the special cheese area at the grocery
store and I'm just going to chop the
halloumi into even pieces around a
centimeter each then I'm going to throw
the halloumi on a dry pan on medium heat
I'm going to cook these until both sides
are brown and this is going to take
around five minutes
well that's cooking I'm going to grab
some pine nuts and I'm going to put them
on a separate dry pan on medium heat and
I'm going to shake the pan occasionally
until they're browned too once that's
finished I'm going to plop them on to
the salad and drizzle some balsamic
glaze and then you're good to serve
for my main course I'm cooking a
favorite of mine which is spaghetti
bolognese and here is what you're going
to need first up you're going to get two
stalks of celery a few carrots and then
an onion you're going to chop all these
ingredients into really fine and even
pieces because that way they soak up the
flavors better and they're going to get
soft
a lot faster then you're going to squash
and roughly chop around four to five
cloves of garlic these don't have to be
even at all if anything you kind of want
them a little bit rough and jagged so
they don't burn on the pan easily once
everything is chopped I'm going to grab
my trusty liqueur set which stuff got me
for my birthday on medium heat I'm going
to add some olive oil and I'm just going
to toss everything in I'm going to cook
this for around ten minutes until the
vegetables are lovely and soft now I'm
going to add some tomato paste and I'm
just going to squeeze in half the tube
I'm not very shy with this and I'm going
to fry this for around three minutes to
take any of the bitterness out and while
that's cooking I'm going to add a
sprinkle of oregano and stir that into
the mix it's time to add the meat and
usually I'll just use a ground chicken
or turkey but this time I went with beef
because it's extra tasty and I've
plopped that in and I'm breaking it
apart with my big ol spoon and while
it's frying I'm going to add a cup of
red wine I've gone for a Spanish wine
Rocca and this is my favorite wine to
drink so I thought why not put it in the
dish I've added plenty of salt and
pepper to season and while that's
cooking out I'm going to add a can of
organic tomato sauce and some freshly
chopped basil I threw in a couple more
cloves of garlic because I want it to be
extra delicious now that everything is
in the pot I'm going to turn the heat
down to a simmer and I'm going to put
the lid on I'm going to cook this for an
hour and a half stirring every 20
minutes or so now that the polonaise is
nearly done I'm going to cook the
spaghetti and serve it all dente
I want to pile the polonaise on top and
I'm going to finish off with some grated
parmesan and more fresh basil because it
tastes good and it looks pretty now it's
ready to serve and everyone can enjoy
finally for dessert I'm making my own
version of a pizookie and I'm cheating
and I'm using a premade mix
sorry about that I just followed the
instructions on the back and you're just
gonna need a brick of butter an egg and
mix don't be dumb like me and use your
hands because it feels very strange I
decided on a fork because it's less
messy and it gets the job done now on a
greased pan I'm going to shape the dough
into small balls and we're going to
place them two inches apart since
they're going to expand put it in the
oven for around ten minutes and once
they're cooked and slightly cooled serve
with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and
candy sprinkles and voila a fast and
delicious dessert did you cook I did
cook it oh yeah yes delicious thank you
so much when you go home
