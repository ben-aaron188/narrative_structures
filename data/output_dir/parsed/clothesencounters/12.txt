- Hi everyone.
Happy New Year!
It's your girl Jenn.
And today I am just finishing up
some loose ends from 2017.
I'm going to be talking
about my December favorites.
I'm really happy to do this because once
I film this and edit this,
that means I have done every monthly
favorite of 2017 and that
makes me feel really good.
I like to complete things.
So, yeah even though this
video is a little late,
I thought I'd do it anyway.
This month we've got a
lot of film favorites.
We've got a book, we've
got a fashion and a beauty.
So let's just dive right in.
I want to start with a
fashion favorite first,
here I have these mismatched
earrings from Pomelo.
I believe I first showed
them to you guys in
my first and only episode of jungle bells.
I rocked them in New
Orleans and I got a ton
of comments asking where they were from,
so I had to put them in this video.
One of the earrings has this cool
silver bar and the other has a pearl.
And I love pairing
these with really simple
and basic outfits because
it instantly gives
that outfit a quirk.
I'm a huge fan of dangly
earrings, as you can tell
and these guys are no exception.
Moving on straight into a book favorite.
I have The Four Agreements
by Don Miguel Ruiz.
And this book came to me at such a
perfect time in my life.
It was actually recommended to me
by two of my friends,
Amy Lee and Anna Lee,
no they're not related.
But this book just really changed the way
I look at life and I feel like these
days I've been really reading a lot of
self-improvement books, but I feel like
they've really helped me
develop who I am today.
So this book teaches you
four agreements, or rules,
that you should always apply in your life
in order for you to
have just like a fuller
and more peaceful life.
So the first rule is to be
impeccable with your word.
It basically says that what you say
actually means a lot.
So be mindful of it.
The second agreement is to
never take anything personally.
And this rule really
resonated with me because
I am a very sensitive person and I take a
lot of things to heart.
And so when you retrain
your mind to realize
that nothing anyone
does is because of you.
It's because of themselves.
Even if someone insults
you or is rude to you,
know that it's not because of you,
it's because of themselves
and the rules that they've
made in their own head.
And I know it kinda doesn't
make sense right now,
but I swear when you read that chapter,
it will be crystal clear.
The third rule is to
never make assumptions.
Because when you assume,
it creates complicated
situations and it says to never be
afraid to ask questions.
If you're confused, don't assume.
Just ask directly.
And I feel like that's something that
I struggled with because sometimes
I don't wanna bother
anyone with my questions,
but when you ask someone
directly what they mean,
or to clarify something, it removes the
possibility of a disagreement.
And so yeah, it says
to always ask questions
and to never assume.
And the last agreement is
to always try your best.
And I love this agreement so much because
I don't really like to half-ass anything,
I like to put everything
into whatever I'm doing.
Whether I'm washing the dishes,
whether I am working on a video.
I feel like this is something
that everyone can apply.
And I know that even if I
mess up or I don't follow
the rest of the agreement as perfectly,
as long as I know I'm trying my best
and I'm improving a little
bit by bit everyday,
that shows for something
at the end of the road.
So yeah that was a little
skeleton of the book.
I highly recommend you
actually go read it though,
because I find that the agreements sink in
much more that way.
And also the way he writes isn't like
flowery and confusing, he writes in a very
crystal clear direct way.
So it can really hit home for anybody.
So I saw multiple movies this month
and to my surprise I have loved every one
single one that I saw.
So the first one I want to talk about
is The Disaster Artist
and it has James Franco,
Dave Franco and Seth
Rogan and like a bunch
of other people, but it's essentially
a movie based on a movie.
And it shows you how
they created The Room,
which is notoriously
known for the greatest
worst film of all time.
The movie was incredible and it actually
propelled me to watch The Room.
And I think they're an
amazing pairing together.
You've got to watch both of them.
And if you actually enjoy The Room,
you and I will have
some sort of connection
because it's one of those movies where you
freaking love it or you're just confused
and you just want to stop it.
But The Disaster Artist,
it really helps you see how bizarre
and passionate Tommy Wiseau is.
He is a character for sure.
And I feel like James Franco
really did an amazing,
like representation of him.
It's incredible.
And it just shows you that you know,
even if you're a little crazy,
as long as you like believe in something
and you put your all in something,
you may get recognized for it
and it's really inspiring
at the end of the day.
I love both movies and
I feel like you should
watch The Disaster Artist first
and then The Room because it will just
make The Room even funnier,
so go check it out.
My next film favorite is called Ladybird
and I also saw this in theaters
and I freaking loved it.
So this is about a teenage
girl named Christine
and she's a senior in high school,
it's her last year so you just kind of
see what she gets into.
This movie is really
about her relationships
with everyone in her life,
like her mom, her best friend,
the guys that she dates, like the way she
feels about college applications.
And I cried twice during this movie,
like one because of sadness
and one 'cause of happiness.
And I love movies that really
take you on a roller coaster.
Like it's not like an action film,
it's like more of a hyper realistic film
where you can truly see
yourself as Christine.
And I feel like it really hit home for me
because, like she and I kind of had like
a very similar high school experience
and so it really resurfaced all these
like old memories and feelings and after
I left, I felt very reflective and
I also felt like a sense of pride
because I've come such a long ways
since my awkward days.
I highly recommend it.
If you kind of grew up
around the early 2000s,
because it is so nostalgic.
And it's one of those films where you
forget you're watching a film
because you're so
invested in the characters
and you really see
yourself in all of them.
So yeah, go check it out.
In December, I colored my hair darker
and I freaking love it.
I feel like a new woman.
But with darker hair comes like the
visibility of dandruff,
so I knew I had to you know take
matters into my own hands.
So I got this shampoo by Briogeo.
It is their scalp revival one.
It comes in a tub, which
kind of tripped me out,
but yeah you just basically scoop
up the shampoo, you rub it in your head
and the little exfoliants
inside the shampoo,
it like exfoliates your
scalp and because of that,
you have no dandruff.
And it has been amazing to use.
I love the way it smells.
It smells like Lush's mask of magnaminty.
So yeah it smells good,
it cleanses my hair
and I am dandruff free.
Lastly, I wanted to show
Ben's Christmas present to me.
He got me this gorgeous plant from Sanso
and I'm obsessed with it.
I feel like it really breeds in life
to the living room, it
really grounds the space.
I love the colors, I love
the way it branches out,
I love the pot, it's stunning.
And right now, I don't
know what to name her,
so if you guys can tell
me what kind of names
you think I could give
her, please write it
in the comments down below,
I would love to hear.
All right guys, that is a
wrap on my December favorites,
it would mean the world to me if you
wrote down what you were inspired by
or what you loved or something good
that happened to you in
the comments down below,
I truly love reading what you guys
have to say and I try my best to answer
as many as I can.
So yeah, feel free to drop some love down.
By the time you're watching this,
I will be in Thailand with Ben
and I am so excited.
I've never traveled there with him
so it will be an adventure for us.
We will definitely be vlogging.
I'm gonna try my best
to vlog all of January
because December I just kind of fell off,
like I was supposed to
have two jungle bells
episodes, but by the
second half of December I
just kind of wanted to take a little break
from vlogging, I was still uploading,
but I just didn't feel
it necessary to vlog,
you know everything like that.
But, I don't know why I'm
like trying to justify this.
Regardless, prepare for
more vlogs this January.
I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye (kisses).
