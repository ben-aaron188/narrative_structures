hey everyone it's me Jen and welcome
back to a new episode of what would Jen
wear but this time it is the winter
edition and in case you're just tuning
in this is a segment where you tweet me
your fashion dilemma and I try my best
to answer it so let's just pan through
them the first week comes from is
invisible
what's a clever date night outfit if my
plans are to go from Netflix Marilyn to
a Christmas cocktail party day to night
transformations are totally doable if I
was just allow them to around my house
this is what I would probably be wearing
it just like a cami and some leggings
but I spruced it up for the cocktail
party by adding a statement moto jacket
this one is a gorgeous cream so it kind
of goes with a whole winter white theme
and I added some crazy heels and these
are actually Stephanie's because I'm in
the process of moving so a lot of my
shoes were already packed but yeah
basically just Nina add a little height
for the Christmas cocktail party and it
would probably make your outfit look
more formal I added these leggings
because they had a big punch but without
compromising that comfy factor and if
you want you can add a red lift to spice
things up more so yeah hope that helps
next up twinkly Lilly asks what would
you wear for a winter date freezing cold
outside but pretty hot inside
it's my dilemma juggling two
temperatures can be really tricky
especially if they're both at extremes
this is the best outfit I came up with
since it's freezing cold outside I added
this super heavy coat and it's really
dense and long which makes it amazing at
blocking out freezing winds and it
insulates you quite well and chances are
you're not going to be outside the
entire time maybe from the car to the
restaurant or wherever you're going so
inside I kind of you know showed some
skin and I went for this great combo
with the turtleneck and the flare skirt
I think it's just a really feminine
silhouette that is very flattering on
everyone
I added some flirty thigh high socks to
compliment my black boots and just a
beret to keep my ears warm and there you
have it something that is good for both
temperatures I think acz asks how does
one wear red and green colors on
Christmas
without looking like an elf well I
actually think it'd be quite cute if you
did Joseph SML for Christmas but that's
just my opinion
but if you want to avoid that situation
and you want to wear red and green I
think the safest way to do that is to
pair it with a timeless pattern that's
why I'm wearing this coat it's a really
nice foreign screen with a pop of red
and I think it's really tasteful and
festive for the season you can also add
a nice red lip to make the red pop out
even more on the coat underneath I went
for a velvet which you frock and I added
a necklace for some interest and there
you have it elf crisis averted moving
right along
here's one from von bristle what would
your go-to outfit be for a casual at
home party with friends and what would
you bring food wise if it's just a
casual house party with some close
friends that I might slum it my first
instinct right now is to stay like a big
oversized cardigan that's really comfy
and nice with some leggings I think this
is a combination that's perfect for
those people who just can't be bothered
sometimes it's kind of like wearing your
pajamas but looking a lot more
presentable as for food I would bring my
chicken and potato dish in Korean is
called pet food ooh tongue and it is so
good it's like made from hot pepper
paste but I like to add a little bit of
green bees in it so it's a little bit
healthier but yeah it's very warming and
very hearty the last question comes from
illusion hi Jan what would you wear with
a romantic new dress in winter here's
one of my favorite new dresses it's just
this nice knit turtleneck one and I
paired it with this fabulous coat it's
something that I can totally see myself
rocking in London next week so I'm
really excited to do it I made it really
romantic by adding these sensual thigh
high boots I like these ones because
they're a better fit on me at least for
my leg it's like a lot more tight around
the calf so I'm really enjoying it and
the height is pretty reasonable it is
definitely a lot lower than my other
thighs but yeah I just thought I'd add
it to the mix to jazz it up I popped on
a beanie and this really sophisticated
necklace and that's it that's how I
style a new dress all right so those are
the questions it's a little short this
time because the Sun is dying and I care
is on its last thread battery wise so
that's just gonna have to do I was
thinking about putting themes for these
what with gender where episodes like for
example this one is winter and I need
help thinking what the next month should
be or the theme for next month should be
so if you have any ideas feel free to
comment down below thank you so much for
watching and I will see in the next
video bye
