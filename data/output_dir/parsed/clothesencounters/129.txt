honestly just not feeling good because
I'm a little hungover I had a little too
many drinks last night

was able to like pound the drinks down
and be fine the next day so frickin
getting older definitely does take a
toll on the drinking recovery process so
that I am just gonna Chuck along to my
parents house in this traffic

on a Saturday whatever where is everyone
going why are we all heading this
direction we have cupich again and then
just a plate of assorted veggies and
chicken they're going to visit them was

though we're sweating like 30 seconds in
there's good fun hey guys welcome back
it is Monday and I would fill you in and
let you know that today I'll just be
editing Ghent umber episode number two
like literally the entire day I would
just be editing this video so
unfortunately there's not going to be
too much footage today so yeah thought I
would inform you and I'll see you
tomorrow
unless something you know surprisingly
awesome happens
all righty so we are back at home
unfortunately I'm not having the best
day I feel like the entire day I've just
had this cloud over my head but to be
honest I think it's because of one I
think I'm coming down with a cold my
throat was very scratchy and number two
I'm on my period and when I'm on my rag
I'm not that fun of a person I mean it's
more like a roller coaster I'm like
happy sad emotional and then ecstatic
and angry for no reason so I'm just a
ball of emotions today and normally I
wouldn't film when I'm feeling like this
but it is gem tumbler and you will
experience different emotions from me
today I also uploaded my spend the day
with me you can watch that video over
here yes that is a sponsored video but I
worked really really hard on it
I know a lot of you guys don't like
seeing sponsored content YouTube is my
career so I do take opportunities like
this especially knowing that YouTube is
not going to be for ever and so I need
to be smart with my time and if I enjoy
the brand I enjoy the products and I
could make some money off of it I don't
think I should be crucified for that I
think when I'm uploading sponsored
content I always feel like kind of like
I'm not in my stomach because I don't
know how you guys are going to take it
just know that I'm trying and I I don't
know I'm just working as hard as I can
alright I'm going to continue editing
gem timber number two and yeah hopefully
my mood gets better talk to guys in a
bit wait what day is it today
yeah oh my god okay hi today is
Wednesday I am on my way to go pick up
Sophia because we are doing a
collaboration with David so here on
YouTube
we're going to be a part of his carpool
confessions series so we're all going to
be guests on his channel it's going to
be a really candid conversation about
whatever we decide to talk about oh my
gosh this mess is so close to me I'm on
my way to pick her up and yeah I'm
really excited I think we're just gonna
drive around do a little checked and
then have some food after so no
complaints here
that GG's Mohammed oh good
G all right guys so I am home now the
shoot went super well I'm so excited to
see how the videos came out
it's literally me Sophia and David just
talking in the car and then we got
ningyuan it was so so freaking good
seriously the best thing that I've ever
ever had and for those who don't know
what that dish is it's like a cold
noodle dish that a lot of people eat in
the summer but anyway I'm back home now
and I got a package in the mail it is a
book it is called 100 imagined ancient
love poems by Daniel Nadler and I found
this because I was randomly on Edward
Norton's Twitter page I don't know how I
got there but he tweeted not saying he
just finished this book and I was like
huh it looks pretty interesting yeah I
never thought I would buy a book of
poems poetry used to piss me off I don't
know why I think it's because you had to
find the symbolism on every single line
but now that I don't have to go to
school anymore I can just really look at
these poems and read them without having
too much pressure on trying to decipher
the meaning of them so yeah I think I'm
just gonna finish off work and get
tucked into this book alrighty you guys
I am ending the vlog here if you enjoyed
