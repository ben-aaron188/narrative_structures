hey what's up it's Jen I've put together
a holiday gift guide and all these items
have my stamp of approval and they're
gifts that I would love to receive and
also give I'm just gonna start off with
the whole unisex category gifts I can
get him or her because I think these
items are the ones that are the most fun
to describe it's flu season and chances
are the person you're gifting is gonna
get sick so why not blow your nose and
grab a tissue in style I found this
really cute house shaped tissue box
I think this adorable little house
casing makes any tacky tissue box into
something very modern and minimalist if
the house is too white you have an
option to paint it whatever color you
want or create a design that is personal
I think everyone needs to have some
green in their room so that's why I'm
showing this cute little spiked planter
which is going to be the perfect home
for an air plant and an airplane is
perfect for those people who aren't
necessarily the best plant owners
because luckily these don't need that
much water you just need a quick mist
maybe a week or so and they're good
another interesting way to incorporate
some plants into his or her life is to
get them a plant display I think that
the setup is really gender neutral
because the vases are beakers that use
in a laboratory you can stick some cute
little flowers for more of a feminine
look or you can stick some branches in
that you find off your lawn for more of
a masculine feel let's say you have a
little bit more wiggle room in your
wallet to really spurge on an item I
would highly recommend this beautiful
souped-up flower vase it's basically the
grown-up version of the previous setup I
showed you I think everyone should read
more including me and so I think it's
good to encourage just movement by
getting a book that you love to someone
you love and if I were to get you yes
you watching a book then these would be
my talk to you the first book I'd get
you is costing the show I buy a Haruki
Murakami and Murakami is one of my
favorite authors because he's a
contemporary surrealist and his stories
just suck you in because his characters
are so vibrant and very
usual I think one reason why I love
Murakami so much is because he describes
mundane activities into full-blown
adventures and for nonfiction I've got
the tipping point by Malcolm Gladwell
and this is just a good book to read if
you just need a sudden slap of reality
to get you motivated because God will
just shows different examples of how
small and deceptively trivial actions
can add up into a full-blown phenomenon
so in other words little things make a
big difference if you would like me to
film a favorite books video and if that
sounds like a cup of tea please give
this video a thumbs up so I can kind of
indicate that that's what you want next
up I have an item that would pump up
anyone for 2014 it's this massive
calendar that fills up an entire wall
it's an amazing gift for students
because you can really laid out your
entire game plan and have it as one
tangible piece as opposed to having it
all digital and pixelized as much as I
love the calendar app on my phone
sometimes I think it feels better to
just write it out on paper as opposed to
typing it on my keyboard my next item is
a really small and simple gift it is
originally a toothbrush holder but I
would gift it as a pencil holder that
way you can really increase the shelf
life of this thing I think it's just a
cute way for someone to store pens and
pencils and just to stay organized
I know I've picked a lot of decor pieces
but I think the environment is so
important to a person's happiness to the
performance level to just their overall
mood so anything that would kind of give
inspiration to someone that I love is a
really good gift in my opinion all right
that being said I'm going to move on to
gifts for her I think any holiday gift
set they can get at Sephora is a good
gift because one you're pretty much
getting a deal because you're buying all
these items in bulk and number two they
did the wrapping for you it's
beautifully packaged and ready to go and
so I have three tart holiday gift sets
that I bought for my friends and I hope
they're not watching this video but if
they are they don't know which one I'm
gonna give them so I think it'd still be
a surprise so the smallest box has
several different lip colors that they
can play
with all in different shades and I love
tarts lip formula because there is a
subtle tingle to it in the medium box
there is a kit for your eyes you've got
your mascara you've got some eyeliner
basically the whole shebang if you want
to have a smoky look with some Vavoom
lashes and the largest box is an
eyeshadow palette with a medley of
different colors that they can explore
and play around with and create endless
combinations of eye looks next up I've
got a candle that smells like cake angel
food to be precise but I think the
candle is a really good gift to give
someone who you don't really know who's
more of an acquaintance it's just a safe
bet that they're gonna like it because
who doesn't love a good candle and I
guess this is a scent that society deems
feminine but honestly if I walked into a
dude's room and he was burning this
candle I wouldn't think anything of it I
would just think hey this guy definitely
a sweet tooth and leave it up that
makeup can be tricky to buy someone
because you don't know their exact shade
or what complements their skin so I
would just take the safe route and get
benefits professional this is one of my
holy grail items something that I put
before I put any makeup on now we are
moving to the boy section my first gift
would be a phone case it is really
similar to mine but in a different color
this one is in a textured black and I
think it looks really clean and very
futuristic and I absolutely love the
functionality of this cell phone case
there is a bunch of slots in the back so
you can put all your important items
like your credit card your ID a
transport ticket it just enables you to
carry light the bad thing is if you lose
your phone you kind of everything so
it's kind of a go big or go home phone
case my next item is a candle for a dude
this is from patio waxes apothecary line
and can get at Urban Outfitters and this
one basically smells like a really nice
clone except being burned in the candle
is in an apothecary bottle which makes a
really boob sickle dick knack if he
decides to place it on a coffee table or
on a shelf to just kind of jazz up the
room if your dudes like this drinks cold
especially whiskey then I would say to
get him some cool ice cubes I have these
really awesome brain ice cubes which i
think are so unique actually I think
this gift
is a total unisex one I personally
received these as a gift from my friend
Stephanie from my birthday a couple
months ago and this has been wonderful
to drink my favorite whiskey and so
those are all my holiday gift ideas I've
compiled all the items that were
available online on to my Lubov Percy
