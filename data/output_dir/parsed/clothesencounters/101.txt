hey everyone happy new year I know
everyone's buzzing about 2017 a new year
new chapter but I'm gonna have to stop
you there because we still have things
to tend to I'm gonna shout out some of
my favorites from December so let's take
a step back and get on with the program
first up on the agenda I have my go-to
Airport outfit in December I travelled a
ton and I pretty much forward the exact
same outfit to the airport every single
time and that included this adidas track
jacket I am just obsessed with this blue
circle triangle print and then it has
the classic adidas stripes on the
shoulders and then on the sleeves
there's a sick Japanese writing I have
no idea what this says I'm assuming it
says something about adidas but who
knows if any of you Japanese subscribers
would like to translate this please do
and write it in the comments down below
anyway it has this brilliant red lining
inside and it's just a really breathable
comfortable material and perfect for
airport travel um
underneath that would just wear some
leggings but for my shoes I would always
always wear my adidas boosts and guys
these are so effing comfortable these
are actually my workout shoes but I
decided to start wearing them to the
airport and it's just changed the game
for me I feel like when I'm wearing
these I have a physical spring back in
my step and I think it's because of the
soul I don't know what kind of
technology or science that use but I
feel like it does give a physical spring
and balance to my step and it just makes
the whole airport process a lot easier
and by the way this is not sponsored by
adidas at all I just feel like when I'm
wearing athleisure outfits like this I
like to align all the brands for this
case it's all adidas if I was wearing
Nike you it all be Nike but I don't know
I feel like this is a fashion faux pas
that's been drilled into my head to not
mix like athletic brands but I don't
know what do you guys think alright now
that we have the airport outfit down I
want to talk about the luggage that I've
been using for years I've been using my
big - squishy bags my big purple squishy
bag named Barney and then my gray
squishy bag that one didn't have a name
but those were my Ryder dies I used the
crap out of them
and unfortunately my purple squishy kept
on getting lost I don't know why I mean
it would always return to me but it
would be a couple days and just the
anxiety of having my belongings just
like out somewhere just kind of freaked
me out and so I think it has to do with
the squishy case and maybe the people at
the airport just didn't care for it and
just kind of forgot about it so I
thought it was time for an upgrade and I
finally got my hands on some Cal Pack
luggage this is the brand that does that
sick marble case luggage but instead I
decided to go with the champagne set
because it's the closest thing to rose
gold and I'm having a heavy rose gold
moment right now from my phone to my
ring it's just it's just my type of
style
I love the ridges it has and 360 wheels
the wheels are super important because
there's nothing worse than traveling
with a luggage that has shitty wheels
it's the worst because you're just
literally dragging all your stuff and
just heaving at the airport it's not fun
so these have great roll great traction
and when you open it it has two sections
you have one compartment for all your
clothes you can zip that up and then the
other part for just whatever else
belongings you have and then you just
stand which it together the same thing
goes with the carry-on I just love
having nice compartments because it
keeps you organized and you just feel
more secure when you're traveling the
whole travel process can be so
exhausting so it's so important to have
everything in its right place so far
with this luggage I've traveled to Dubai
in Hawaii and on my big suitcase there's
a little bit of dings here and there but
honestly I I don't really mind because
it's made for wear and tear and I mean
it's just the way the airport handles
things I am planning on filming how I
packed my suitcase / luggage video in
February it's been on my to film list
for like years at this point so I'm
gonna finally try and crack down and
film it in February on you guys can keep
me accountable for that for my beauty
favorite I have tarts shaped tape
concealer and man I am pretty late on
the game with this one it's already been
blasted all over the YouTube Beauty
blogosphere but hey at least I'm finally
on the train now so what I like to do
with this is before foundation
I will DOT it all underneath my eyes and
with a damp Beauty Blender I'll just
blend that baby in at first it can go on
a little pasty but you just have to work
it in and then it'll start blending
seamlessly this is definitely more of a
brightening tool as opposed to like a
spot concealer type this just targets
the dark areas on your skin and just
really highlights and brightens them
I've noticed that since using this I
look a lot more fresh-faced and awake
but maybe not today because I'm pretty
sick right now I don't know if you can
tell I was gonna say this disclaimer at
the beginning of the video but then I
didn't want you guys just notice my
sniffily raspy voice but yeah I'm sick
right now so I'm just gonna move on to
the next product
by now a lot of you guys know that I get
into deep phases with certain chokers
and necklaces and a lot of you guys have
noticed this little Jay necklace that
I've been wearing non-stop every time I
wear it so many of you guys asked me
where it's from it's always in the
description box but I thought I would
throw it in a favourites just to just
give it its time it needs to be
highlighted this is from if in Co and my
friend James actually custom-made it for
me and I just love every detail that he
put in I love this glimmering gold chain
and the little diamonds in the J it's
just perfect and I couldn't be more
happy with it and if you guys ever need
anything custom jewelry made I highly
recommend the guys I think oh they're
hard-working genuine people it's a small
family-run business and I feel proud to
support them Ben and I are actually
thinking about getting our wedding rings
down there so I'll let you know if that
ever happens for a book favorite I have
the girl on the train by Paula Hawkins
and I have always been intrigued by this
book but when the film came out and it
got bad reviews it kind of heard me from
reading this but I knew I was traveling
and I knew like the my plane journey was
like 15 hours long so I knew that I
wanted something fast to read and oh my
god I slammed through this book so this
book is about a woman named Rachel she's
divorced she's an alcoholic and just
life is looking pretty grim for her and
every day she goes in the train for her
commute and she passes the same
neighborhoods and surroundings and
there's just this one couple that she
just becomes infatuated with obsessed
with she thinks that they have this
perfect life and she's even giving them
like fake names it's really creepy and
then one day something happens something
bad and I'll tell you what because I do
not want to
we'll anything honestly it's these
moments where I wish I had a book club
because then we can really dive it into
the book and talk about all the things
that happened but regardless this book
is definitely a psychological thriller
and it makes you think of the concept of
the grass being greener on the other
side because that's never ever the case
now that I finished the book I am kind
of intrigued about watching the movie
just to see how bad it is chances are
it's gonna be out on Netflix later this
year you guys I finally have a music
favourite for you I know it's been a
couple months since I've recommended
anything but it's because I was in a
music drought but luckily my friend
Kristen showed me the light and
introduced me to the artist Thomas this
has been the only artist I've been
listening to since December and
discovering him I have got been hooked I
got my friends hooked and now I'm hoping
to get you guys hooked this is one of
those rare artists where I love every
single one of his songs everything is so
good the first song I heard was called
crazy dream I was driving and five
seconds in I was like I love this song
and I just repeated it over and over and
over again and then it snowballed into
me listening to his beat tapes to EP and
then the rest of his singles I'm really
horrible at describing music genres but
for him I would say it's kind of like a
beat but relaxing I know those are two
opposite but when you hear it you'll
know what I mean this is like the type
of music that you put on when your
friends over when you're stunning when
you're driving when your parents are
over just pretty much anything
it's like inoffensive music pretty much
I don't see how anyone can not like it
but maybe I'm just heavily biased my
favorite favorite songs to get you guys
kind of started is so close in the midst
of it all night gowns and sunshine and
then crazy dream I don't know I've got a
lot so I will put my top five in the
description box so please please listen
to it and give your ears a nice treat
lastly I have a TV show favorite it's
called insecure and it's on HBO and my
friend Andy actually recommended it to
me and Ben and I just smash through the
whole season this show doesn't have
enough recognition which is why I
thought I should put it in my favorites
it follows a woman named Issa and she's
just really relatable and likable and I
would just love to be your friend
and it kind of follows her life in Los
Angeles shows her relationships with
people and just little slices of her
life pretty much she has the best friend
who can't lock down a man and even he
said her boyfriend or kind of plateau me
and I know it doesn't sound that
interesting but you just have to watch
it there's just something so authentic
relatable and just nothing seems staged
with Jack which I like because I feel
like a lot of shows that I watch
sometimes the chemistry is off and
that's all I can notice but with this
show I feel like everything just flows
and it's about like real topics and I
love that also since it takes place in
Los Angeles I always get super excited
when I recognize the place I'm like oh
I've been there or oh my gosh that's
near my house oh so I get really excited
about that and the soundtrack is poppin
I love every artist to use they use
really modern ones and independent ones
and every time something plays I'm like
trying to jot down what song it is
definitely go check it out it's only one
season so you can binge watch and catch
up alright guys those are all my
favorites for now as usual please write
down your favorites in the comments down
below right now I am looking for
specific recommendations on books films
and music so any of those three pop them
down below and a lot of you guys are
asking questions about who when's the
proposal video coming out and it's
probably gonna be out later this month
maybe early February we'll see Ben
actually secretly filmed the entire
thing and had I known he was filming it
I would have cried a little bit more
gently I don't know like when I was
editing my goodbye 2016 video I put in a
clip from the proposal and I had a mute
it because I was just sobbing
uncontrollably like you have no idea
what I was saying I'm like like it's
it's bad um so I mean we'll see how it
comes out I feel like the people outside
probably thought I was like getting
broken up with or something but it was
just like it was just a beautiful moment
nonetheless and I'm like excited to
share it with you guys the past few days
just have been the best days of my life
like Ben and I are buzzin about being
engaged and a lot of you guys are
wondering like when the wedding is gonna
be and it's
like most couples it's not gonna be for
a while because oh my god wedding
planning oh god it's like it's pretty
daunting like I can barely plan my own
birthday party let alone a entire
wedding with two families I mean we'll
figure it out step by step um but yeah I
just wanted to give you guys a little
update um I feel like my voice from the
beginning of a video to the end it's
definitely gotten a lot more raspy since
the end but yeah I'm gonna rest my voice
now and I want to thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next one bye guys
you
