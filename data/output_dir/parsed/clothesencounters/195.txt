hi guys it's me Jen and today I'll be
showing you some of the trash that I've
accumulated over the year and as you can
see I have quite a number of products so
I thought I would kind of divide things
by section so I'm gonna start off with
skincare the first empty product I'll be
showing you is origins checks and
balances and this is just a cream facial
cleanser and prior to using this I was
using a vinos foaming cleanser and I was
loving that until it just started to
strip my skin my face felt a lot more
dry and patchy and then I read online
that I should switch on over to using a
cream cleanser and this origins one just
kind of stuck with me I keep this one in
the shower because I mean I like to have
one by my sink and then in my shower
depending on if I'm gonna take a shower
in the morning Ben is a huge fan of it
as well and just a little bit goes a
long way when you put it in your hands
and you rub it it just foams up into
this really dense luxurious foam and my
face feels squeaky clean after but not
dry
another facial cleanser that I used up
is sk two's facial treatment gentle
cleanser and i'm gonna be real this is
not a cheap product this is around 75
bucks a pop so it's pretty crazy for
those who aren't willing to invest in
skincare but if you have the funds and
sq2 parts work well with your skin then
i would say go for it I personally got
this cleanser as a freebie when I went
on an esky two trip and yeah they're not
paying me to put this in the video I
just you just gave me the products to
try out and now I'm giving you my review
what I really liked about this cleanser
was how hydrating it was after you wash
your face your face doesn't feel really
tight and like any like anything's
pulling it so I thought that was really
awesome
this smells quite nice it's a really
gentle rosy smell and it does last for a
really long time it took me a year to
finish this bottle so I guess that kind
of justifies the price either way I'm
not in an immediate rush to buy this
again
the origins ones does a really good job
you know give him a face in check but if
I ever got older and for some reason
this wasn't working out for me I would
definitely revisit this one again
the next SK 2 empty is their facial
treatment essence and this is by far my
favorite product of their entire line
it's definitely one of my Holy Grail
products and if you are willing to
splurge on skincare this is the item
that I would shell out for and basically
you apply this after you tone and I'll
put like three generous splashes on my
hand and then I'll gently Pat that into
my face and it kind of smells weird it's
like pungent but you just get used to
the smell this essence is packed with
Patera which is sk 2 s you know magic
ingredient it's got a lot of anti-aging
properties and just all the essential
nutrients and amino acids that are good
for your skin either way I've been using
this for over a year now and my skin has
been looking happy and healthy and I
don't see any crazy fine lines so I'm
just gonna continue using this this is
something that I'm going to continue
shelling out for and I guess we'll just
see how it preserves my face my last
skincare empty is Aesop's B and T
balancing toner
and this actually made an appearance in
my favourites earlier this year so I
finished it spoiler alert and the woman
was working at ESOP recommended this to
me because I just went inside the store
just looking for a toner and she
basically said that this one is
compatible with all skin types including
gentles so I went ahead and gave it a
whirl and you apply a toner after you
cleanse the face we'll just put it on a
little cotton pad and just basically
just swipe it on your face and it will
take off any makeup residue and it'll
just balance the pH levels on your face
and I think the best part about this is
definitely the fragrance it's just very
earthy and herbal and just it just
smells like ESOP you just got to go to
the store and smell everything because
everything smells great in there but the
thing with this toner is even when I
finished it I wasn't you know in a rush
to repurchase it I think I'm just kind
of you know exploring different toners
and seeing what my options are but if
you're in the market for a new toner I
mean you could give this one a shot now
I'm going to move on to hair empties I
used up to styling creams by wen and my
friend slash hair stylist actually
introduced me to this brand and now I
just like can't look back I use all
their cleansing conditioners a user
styling
Meem they're freaking moose everything
I'm obsessed with it and yeah it's all
thanks to Anna Lee and styling créme is
something that you use after you wash
your hair it's kind of like a leave-in
conditioner you'll put in like three or
four pumps on each side and it just
makes your hair really silky voluminous
and just ready for styling you think
that with all that product your hair
will just way down but not not with this
styling cream
the first styling cream that I used up
was the scent fig and I did everything
that the styling cream was supposed to
do but I just wasn't a huge fan of the
scent it's just kind of musky I bought
this online so I just kind of went on a
whim I used it up but I don't think I'll
be getting this scent again the summer
honey peach on the other hand just smell
divine this is part of their seasonal
scent so it comes out every summer and
oh my god it just
oh it just reminds me of the summer
seriously it's just really fruity and it
just makes you feel like you're on
vacation just good times with the scent
I absolutely love it so I used both of
these up and now I'm using the sweet
almond mint sweet almond mint styling
cream so that's what my hair smells like
now so now I'm going to shift on to body
products I finally finished my
philosophies french vanilla bean this is
a body wash but also a shampoo I'm for
bubble baths but I've never done the
last two I only used it as a body wash
and when I first got this wow the smell
was incredible it's just like the
perfect warm smell of vanilla
oh man okay so now that I haven't used
it in a while it smells good again but
after like a full year of using this I
just got sick of the scent but the thing
is if you really like the smell of
vanilla you're gonna love this I think
this is a really great winter smell
because winter and vanilla I just feel
like go hand-in-hand
as for me I'm probably not gonna buy
this for a while only because I had to
stick with it for such a long time um
yeah there's not much else to say about
this actually so I'm gonna move on to
the next product next up I have a hand
soap from ESOP and this is by far my
favorite hand soap in the entire world I
originally just got one bottle for my
regular restroom and then after I
finished that bottle I just
get enough so I got one for the kitchen
the guest bathroom and for my regular
bathroom and I'm still not taking the
scent it just smells amazing it's kind
of citrusy and herbal and you just got a
smell out for yourself because oh look
at that's about to drop and honestly
every time I have guests over and they
end up using the bathroom and using the
soap they always complement it so I feel
like in my heart that kind of justifies
the steep price tag this last section is
really great for those who wear soft
contact lenses so if you are on like the
monthly or weekly contact lens
prescription then I highly recommend you
use clear care as you can see I use a
lot of these bottles up and I've talked
about this product in a favorites last
year when I had my eye infection my
optometrist basically told me that I
needed to switch out to a formula with
hydrogen peroxide because my regular
saline solution wasn't disinfecting
enough so once I switched to this I
never got an eye infection my contact
lenses feel practically brand-new and
yeah I just can't look back but before
you get this make sure you read the
direction of the back because you don't
use this like a normal saline solution
it's like a whole new way to use a
solution if that makes sense so
definitely read the back I'm not going
to go over that because this isn't a
tutorial on how to use this the thing is
I don't know why I didn't switch my
prescription to daily contacts yet I
think it's because I still have like a
year left of just monthly contact lenses
but either way I highly recommend clear
care love this stuff alright so those
are all my empties I'll actually no I'm
totally lying I have like three or four
more products that I haven't talked
about that are empty but I didn't want
this video to be too long but if you
only do like a part two I'll save like
some more of my empty products and then
I'll do another empties video there's a
product that you've always been kind of
curious about and you want me to test it
I would love to do that as well so
please comment down below and yeah I
I've nothing else to say thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in my
next video hi
