hi everyone it's a girl again and today
I am finally filming my favorite book of
all time video this is actually one of
my most requested videos and I thought I
would just buckle down film today and it
was just the problem was that it was
really hard to narrow it down to only
ten books but I try to make it as
well-rounded as possible just kind of
genres for everybody also if you are not
subscribed by now what are you waiting
for the buttons down below come join the
family skip today and with that said
let's get cracking with the book the
first book I'm going to recommend is
East of Eden by John Steinbeck this book
is the classic it's just like a
piece of literature that I feel like
everyone needs to read before they die I
mean there's a reason why this is a sign
reading in school but I know it's not
fun when you're forced to read it and
you're getting graded on it but I swear
with fresh eyes and like reading
recreationally this book is going to
take you on a journey it's about two
families the traps and the Hamiltons and
there's just a whole lot of drama the
tea has been spilt and it goes on
generations I feel like this book has
everything you need in a story it's got
guilt
it's got rivalry it's got struggle to be
loved and finding acceptance and also I
feel like this book has the best villain
of all time Kathy she is psycho she's
crazy and just raunchy and she just does
like the craziest stuff and she just
kept me thoroughly entertained every
time she was in a tough girl it's like
ask my girls back it's very clear easy
to understand and it's just a
masterpiece
moving on to book number two I have
coughed on the shore by Haruki Murakami
I have read a number of Murakami books
like whine deferred Chronicle Norwegian
Wood but coughs on the shore will always
remain my favorite it's about a boy a
teenagers runs away from home and he
tries to find his lost mom his lost
sister and he ends up spending some time
in this little town and he works at a
library and that's where things start to
get a little twisted a little dark and
very very surreal one of the main
reasons why I love
Murakami is that he really takes you on
psychological Mindbenders like you
really don't know where he's going to
take you and he creates such vivid
scenes that I would have never imagined
and I love the fact that he just takes
you from point A to B to C to C just
everywhere I remember when I was reading
this I was really trying to learn how to
lucid dream I was drinking all these
peas and all this stuff and reading a
Murakami just made me feel like I was
dreaming that was the closest I've ever
come to lucid dreaming
I've never met an author or I've never
read an author like Murakami and so I
think it's so cool that he had his own
distinct way of writing and storytelling
if you're the type of person that needs
all the buttons button and all the end
ties in a pretty bow I'm not sure if
you'll like this because this is more
about the journey and the experience
then like a clear explanation my next
book is the five people you meet in
heaven by Mitch Albom this is one of
those books I can just smash out in a
day or read on vacation it's a little
bit of like nice happy book it's about a
bold man named Eddie and he's just kind
of lived like a dull meaningless life
and on his 83rd birthday he died I mean
that's not a spoiler alert it happens
within like the first chapter and also
clearly he dies because heaven is in the
title but each one of these people he
meets they explain his connection with
him and how like they changed his life
were vice-versa knowingly or unknowingly
some people might think is corny or
cheesy but I love this book I thought it
would it lets me feeling a lot happy and
warm inside and so if you're looking
just for like a quick happy read this is
the one for you all right going to keep
cracking on my next book is ready player
one by Ernest Cline and this was
actually recommended by a bunch of you
guys so thank you you know me so well
this is one of my favorites now this is
a sci-fi dystopian novel which is like
right up my alley
I love books like this and it is in a
world where just everything is in
shambles like everyone pretty much
everyone's living in poverty because
global warming is just taking a toll and
a lot of people just escape this world
by going into this virtual reality
called the Oasis it's kind of like the
matrix in it
the main character is a teen named Wade
and he spends all his time in the Oasis
and he is dying to play like this
scavenger hunt game because the winner
of that game is like it's kinda like
winning the lottery
so a lot of people see that as their way
out of poverty and wage just has to go
through all these crazy adventures and
there's so many eighties references and
I love it it really takes you on a
thrilling adventure definitely recommend
it if you're looking for just like a fun
adventurous read moving on to more
dystopias have to feature 1984 by George
Orwell this is another literary classic
highly recommend it's about a world
where the government controls absolutely
everything even the way people think and
there's no sense of individuality
there's no speaking up it's like a
tyranny where just the government is
constantly watching Big Brother's
watching and it's all of the bending
Winston and his job as an editor so he
rewrites documents and just like you
know photoshopped photos so these
historical documents follow the
government story from an outside
perspective Winston is like a good man
following and showing face but in
actuality he is just freakin miserable
and he's trying to find a way to rebel
and resist this is a very bleak read but
I just I find these stories so
fascinating because this could have
easily happened to where we live now and
there are places in the world where this
is a reality and not just the story also
Marcia is the one who bought me this
coffee for Christmas a few years ago so
thanks babes so this is my last book on
just opiate I promise I could honestly
film like an entire separate video of
like my favorite sci-fi slash dystopian
novels but maybe I'll see that for
another time how to mention can make
Tale by Margaret Atwood and I'll like
you five times more if you have read
this book in this world women have
absolutely no rights they can't have a
job they can't have money they can't
read they can't write they're all
assigned to these rules and some women
are wives those it like the better off
women and then some of them are on which
are like just kind of like the maid
facilitators and then there are handmade
and The Handmaid's are the ones that
literally just have to give birth and
and it's not a it's not a good role like
these women to get raped every month
this is also a TV show on who so if you
are not going to read this book I highly
recommend the TV show it's the best
every Wednesday
so yeah check check out the book or
check out the show so my next book is
the secret history by Donna Tartt
unfortunately I don't have a physical
copy because I bought it on my Kindle
but this is me holding my imaginary
coffee it is the story of a group of
students in this really prestigious
elite University and it's a murder
mystery the main character is named
Richard and he doesn't come from money
so he just kind of plopped into this
world where just where everyone's just
wealthy and everyone's like super posh
and he's in a class a very small class
that studied ancient history and one of
the students dies but you don't know who
did it or why so that's where the story
kind of takes off this kind of reminds
me of and then there were none but like
the teenage version I mentioned this
book not too long ago in my favorites
but it's the Picture of Dorian Gray by
Oscar Wilde I love this book quick
summary it's about a man named Dorian
he's very attractive young and he gets
his portrait painted and he meets this
man named Lord Henry Wotton and he lives
just like a super hedonistic lifestyle
he gives like zero ups for anyone but
himself
so Dorian and gets very inspired by that
and he ends up selling a soul so he can
look young forever and he just lives
this very materialistic life and he's
just just living for himself just
selfish and he's just like a big dick I
read this book when I was 18 or 19 and
it taught me just to balance not go
overboard it taught me the importance of
not being so decadent and knowing my
limit my next book recommendation has
such sentimental lottery to me is the
Perks of Being a Wallflower I read this
book when I was 15
and it just left such a huge impact on
my life because this is one of the first
books that I read outside of my I signed
reading so when I when I read a book
like this and I solve the story it was
like a storyline that I was just
genuinely interested in and there were a
lot of characteristics of the main
character Tarly that just that I felt
like he just got me he was sensitive and
introverted and those were the the
personality traits that defined me
especially when I was younger and when I
reread it as an adult there was
reflective huge overwhelming wave of
nostalgia it's crazy that when you
revisit something from your past that
you love so much to be transported and
feel that that same way is just it's
insane it's like it's like a time
machine so this book will always have a
special place in my heart and it's very
interesting in an unconventional
coming-of-age story but I feel like I
understand why this is affected so many
teens my last book is my first
non-fiction on the list it is the seven
Habits of Highly Effective People by
Stephen Covey
I am also mentioned this in my monthly
favorites but I have to mention it again
because this is this this has changed my
life in such a positive way I feel like
I'm always trying to find ways to
increase my productivity my efficacy and
my self growth and this book just hit
all those targets for me obviously this
book is about seven Habits that make you
more effective but if I feel like it's
beyond just that this book has taught me
to be more self aware and to be a better
person
and I can easily just tell you what the
seven habits are but they're they're not
going to make sense until you read the
book read each of the stories attached
with the lesson and then you'll really
absorb it I'm actually on my second time
reading this book because it's not one
of those books that you just read once
and you're like ah like I just I want to
remember these lessons for the rest of
my life and apply them that way
alrighty guys those were my top ten
favorite books of all time and ensuite I
had so much fun like filming his videos
explaining all the book and I would love
to I mean
I don't know if you guys would be
interested in me doing another like book
countdown I have like so many other
recommendations I could use to another
like ten more favorite books or I can do
like books on just self-help or just
sci-fi or just fiction like I don't know
that there's so many possibilities also
I would absolutely love it if you would
tell me your favorite book
recommendations along with a little
summary and while you like it I would
love to read what you guys read it's
crazy how much I love reading
recreationally because it really just
brought into my horizons and it brings
light to so many stories that I
otherwise would have never known and I
think it's an art form that everyone or
not an art form but like a skill that
everyone should should usual eyes
because the brain is such like a
powerful tool and it needs to be like
worked out and I feel like reading just
really keeps your brain stimulated in
like a good way I'm not a scientist but
I just feel like it does that anyway I
hope you guys enjoy this video hope you
have a beautiful day and I'll see you
guys in the next one
you
