hi everyone it's your girl Jen I'm here
with the third installment of what would
Jen wear which is a segment where you
tweet me your fashion dilemma and I
answer it
so the first tweet comes from Nina in
Turkey and she asks what would Jenna
wear to a coffee shop cash up with
friends smiley-faced
if I'm having a quick coffee sesh with
some girlfriends then this is what I
would wear I decided to style a very
feminine dress covered in polka dots
because there's something about caffeine
and dresses that is just a really good
combination over it I decided to wear a
fuzzy textured jacket because let's face
it
not all men understand the textured
trend I added a wide brimmed hat and
some silver earrings to jazz up the rest
of the outfit for shoes I decided to
pick these classic black patent boots
for the shop Suzy because I like shiny
things and there we go we've got a cute
and quirky coffee Ketchum outfit and
next week comes from now golden and she
asks hanging out with a boy I like for a
day of gaming and watching movies how do
I find the balance between fashionable
and nonchalant okay if you two are going
to be spending most of your time indoors
then it's so crucial that you're
comfortable so I picked this outfit for
you this is very suitable for an
environment like that I am wearing an
oversized grey sweater dress that I just
wore with tights since it's winter you
might get cold so I threw on a black
knit hoodie and then I threw out a
colorful beanie so I'm not too gray and
black for shoes I think it's important
to have something that are totally
fuss-free
so I'm wearing these very comfortable
pointed flats that are amazing too
slipping out of other than that I hope
you have fun on your date I'm sure he's
gonna like you regardless of what you're
wearing the next tweet is from Viva X a
precise I like wearing hats and beanies
how do I deal with hat slash beanie hair
I just don't take my beanie off once I
commit to a hat or a beanie I just wear
it the rest of the day unless it gets
really really hot and then I'll take it
off and I'll just accept the fact that
I'll have flat hair if you really can't
stand having hat hair then you can
always spruce it up by using some dry
shampoo moving on this
wheat is from sriracha babe whoo I love
that hot sauce I'm going to an Arctic
Monkeys concert soon yay but I have no
idea what to wear please help me out
okay this is really exciting because I
love dressing for shows anyway if I were
going to the show I would probably wear
this outfit it is so totally 90s because
I have a floor-length cardigan this
cardigan is so long and thick so it's
going to be perfect when you're waiting
in line in the cold before you get
inside the show for my top I am just
wearing a very very simple black
turtleneck I decide to add some bling
with my silver and gold chain choker
since you're going to be standing or
dancing I think it's important that you
are something very comfortable for your
bottoms so I am wearing these pumpy
jeans these are a great wash because
they're a flattering dark indigo and I
think that color complements every
single body type for shoes I'm wearing
my metallic ankle boots which are
perfect to dance in or if you're more of
a head bob where you can do that too
guys a tweet from Carmina minicar and
the question is I have a dilemma of
always waking up late thus having
minimal time to plan outfits
what's a never-fail outfit that I can
use a fail-proof
outfit for me always includes a white
button-down because they're so crisp and
timeless and there's something very
Audrey Hepburn about it mine used to be
long but I just hacked it off with a
pair of scissors and created a cropped
one I think it's really important to
realize that a lot of your clothes are
customizable if there's something weird
about it don't be scared to cut it
because if you don't crop it or make it
into the shape that you want then you're
not going to wear it anyways so you
might as well just jump the gun and
create what you want with what you have
that tangent aside I added a gold
necklace for some personality and
underneath I'm wearing my favorite H&M
skinny jeans that you've seen a million
times and then I'm wearing my pair of
effortless patent lace-up boots they've
got a zipper on the side of it so you
don't have to spend 10 minutes fumbling
around the laces and voila here is a
timeless outfit that will make everyone
think you spent more than 20 minutes to
get dressed salteena
tweets what kind of nail polish is great
to wear on New Year's
any nail polish is good as long as you
like to wear it there's no perfect nail
polish it's perfect if you like it and
the polish that I'm probably going to
wear is wicked by Essie because that's
what I'm wearing right now and chances
are I'm not going to repaint them next
tweet is from Iowa's Stoltz and it says
bought tartan skirt no clue what to wear
it with tartan skirts can be really
tricky because it is such a loud and
in-your-face print but I think you can
totally make it work by pairing it with
some key items for my top I've got a
great black knit crop sweater make sure
you find one that hits you at the right
part of your body I added a navy knit
cardigan over my outfit because it's
winter and I can I can use some extra
layers and then I wore my chunky boots
because I'm a chunky boot kind of gal I
own a lot of them and I'm not afraid to
wear them for accessories I wore my eye
of raw earrings and that's it Phoebe
fobia asks what to wear with crop
sweaters not including skirts by the way
I love you heart okay so I love you too
and I love crop sweaters crop sweaters
go with anything including skirts but
for you I decided to wear some pants and
I decided to wear these crazy-looking
statement pants because why not and on
top I wore a great crop sweater because
there were hints of gray the pants so I
thought it would coordinate really well
and then I wore gold accents around my
neck and on my shoes so the last tweet
comes from the wananga and she asks Jen
I just purchased a jean jacket two sizes
bigger than my usual size how would you
style the oversized jean jacket so when
I see an oversized piece than I see an
opportunity to layer and honestly I
think a oversized JAC in the winter is a
blessing because you can wear thick
sweaters and layer stuff to keep you
super warm so for my first layer I'm
wearing a batwing striped sweater it's
chic and simple and perfect for any
occasion
for layer number two I added a gray
hoodie and then for my last layer I'm
wearing my huge jean jacket all over it
and of course there's room to add more
layers if it's colder where you are but
I'm just going to leave it to three
because it's not really that cold where
I live so that's all the time I have
today for this
segment of what would Jenny where if you
would like to be in the next episode
