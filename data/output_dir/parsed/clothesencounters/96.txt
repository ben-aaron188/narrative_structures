I promise we'll be worth it just be
patient and I think they never like to
thank you guys about everyone who shows
their support and love for Ben
I've been denied been denied or Bennett
bend in my engagement it just let the
whole world to me and ah definitely one
of the best weak survive probably the
best days of my life I never like to
show you guys how insane this bathroom
is there's a lot of mirrors one lighting
my brush in T another one behind you and
then also one on the shower yeah if you
like mirrors in the bathroom hotel
please okay I'm going to nail ball Kelly
okay the first two hours since we would
Bellamy
awesome thank you yeah okay all right
okay well I'm here now about to get my
nails done little cow chips these are it
almost looks like a metallic French tip
though so okay let's go in all right
guys Neal are done I went for a nice
community and I went for similar color
on my toes
all right now we are shopping on lunch
at for two things I came over to me here
because we got to mine it
or the birthday of Dinah Lee we came
here once before and that was in the
unique observer Medicare is very
Parisian correspond I would imagine it
looks something like this and I thought
about that all right carbs on carbs yes
we're going to help you go to a
butternut squash seeds and over here we
have a beef salad we have take risks and
a thorough nasal chicken at the grand
finale this is a cranberry biryeo
consider this is a chocolate tart I
believe has been making the best angle
okay so we're back home from lunch lunch
was delicious by the way
and I'm not sure if I mentioned this to
you guys but I have a thigh in my right
I probably can't see it from here but
it's very very painful it's one of those
internal ones I think it's called like a
hoard of something Portillo m40 olam
ones like a freaking spell that's what I
have in my eye
but i snapchatted my my condition and i
asked you guys to send me some of your
remedies and I thought I would try some
out Stormborn said get a sauce so it was
rice and warm it in the microwave apply
it for 10 minutes and I'll act as a hot
compress I'm gonna try and make this
clear up as soon as possible I mean my
friend Emily she headaches died a couple
of times and one of the times she had to
go to the doctor and they add a like
manually squeezed it out so I'm hoping
my side doesn't get to that level
crossing my fingers but yeah I thought I
would try this remedy first okay it's
been 40 quicken and now I'm going to put
it on my eye I'm wrapping it with a
paper towel because even though it's
clean is still something weird about
putting a soft near your eye
all right going to set the timer for 10
minutes all right here we go
ah now the rice smells really good
okay 10 minutes is up I see no visible
difference but I didn't expect you to
work right away but I feel like hot
compress is the number one thing that
you guys have commented so I guess I'll
just keep doing that I'm actually going
to go to my parents house right now just
to see my mom and my dad I've seen a
minimum like we can have I'm going to
have dinner
kek cheeky and children cheeky thing
haircut just good Kiki
hi guys what's last back on the road now
by the way I just uploaded my Dino a
photo on Instagram and like I said with
my site I can wear it signing up and a
lot of you guys at home when I'm doing
my no eye makeup look I think a lot of
you think that it's like intentional but
it's actually because I can't because of
my thigh but yeah everyone's like yeah
and look there's the natural look and it
just made me realize like yeah sometimes
like why do I smell and I make out
especially when I think I get
camera-ready clearly you guys don't care
it's probably better than my ought to
have excel file designs also I want to
know that Ben's parents are coming to
town tomorrow and I'm really excited
actually I'm excited nervous I feel like
with parents even though I've met them
multiple times just like many parents
just gives me a little bit of anxiety
even though there are the nicest people
in the world so they're going to be
staying with us for two weeks so it's
going to be a lot of funding and a lot
of fun then as being a parent in a
school year so it's going to be a huge
treat for him till then and I have been
kind of planning some opportunities we
can do supposedly that he's really good
at that stuff so you're going to see
them pump in in a few clips hopefully
and I believe later this month my
parents and his parents are going to
meet for the very first time who's happy
to be interesting
this one's letters too much right now
it's so distracting also I just realized
that I probably need to throw away all
my eye makeup not all of it but the sky
has been touching my waterline so all my
pencil eyeliners my mascara they're a
primer so I'm going to be making a
border on Sephora
today so I'm back home and now I'm going
to do remedy number two which you guys
suggested which was to put green tea
bags on your eye so here I have this one
by nume Jasmine green tea has put the
kettle on and I'm going to see if this
work then also went to Target and he
thought me is this guy I relief by
similar Sun squeeze plastic applicator
two to three drops three or four times
per day discard after 30 days okay so
maybe I'll put this in first and then
I'll put the green tea contest over it
we didn't go on the battery option no
I'm in the bathroom now I started to
wash my face first before I apply
anything so let me try all these
remedies right now similar Sun let's see
what you got
alright I put it where diet oh my god
there's one okay I put three drops it
okay let's see if the kettle does boilie
all right the tea bag has been drained
and it's about to go in my eye now Alexa
