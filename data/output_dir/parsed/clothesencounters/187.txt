hi guys welcome to the first day so far
today I've eaten breakfast I've done a
workout and now I am going to put my
outfit on so I can make it in time for a
meeting my meeting is at 11 a.m. so I
have 35 minutes to get to Melrose so
let's see if I can do this oh also Ben
is in town all right so the meeting went
well and now we're just gonna head off
and get some lunch so we settled toward
the Grove because I have to get some
plates and cups at cratenbarrel
and I got a chicken salad and Ben got
chicken pasta yeah so jealous and they
have all these lovely Christmas
decorations outside so festive
it's a really great way to spend
December first
heading into Crichton Barrow now yeah
placed maybe even a pencil it's the
water heater water heater Wow
oh my god have festive everything looks
so cute these are options for the kettle
I think we might pass because we need a
bigger one be two times the size yeah hi
guys so I just finished my LensCrafters
appointment I originally went in to get
these glasses REE prescribed because the
lenses are so scratched up because I
just shoved him in my backpack one day
well when I was traveling and everything
smashed him up basically they just told
me that they can't put new ones in these
because there's a 60 40 % chance 60/40
chance that it's going to break and so I
don't know we're just so good at the new
ones they they said it was gonna be okay
I didn't yeah it's gonna do that in a
banana yeah you guys were with me when I
got these glasses - all right so I'm
stop wallowing new year new glasses
I came to Target to try and find a new
vlogging camera because vlogging with
this DSLR isn't ideal but none of the
options I'm looking for I'm looking for
that a little bit Olympus PEN something
or the canon g7x but neither of them are
here and targets oh look
so I guess gotta continue caring okay
this Canon t3i oh shoot yeah I know
also we met a lovely subscriber
Christina it was so nice to see you okay
Ben and I are back home I'm just gonna
pick up the glasses tomorrow because I
just didn't want to stay in that Plaza
for an hour and a half so we're back
home I'm just gonna clean up the house
because it needs some sprucing up
check out this chair everyone has that
chair so I need to figure this out and
hang all my clothes until anything else
interesting happens I'll see you then
bye we picked up my classes they were
finished so we decided to pop it on over
to LensCrafters and get them I really
liked it but I really forget how warped
everything looks when you get a fresh
pair of glasses
guys look I'm gonna giant fishbowl but
everything is very very clear thought I
would pop in to say that I got these
glasses are there from DITA and I
freaking love them anyway I'll see you
guys tomorrow for jingle bells - good
boys there you go oh oh and we also
clean the house chair is clean
hi guys welcome to day two of jingle
bells and I did my workout I took a
shower wash my hair and today I am just
gonna film I'm filming my November
favorites and editing a couple videos
that are gonna be out later this month
this is kind of like behind the scenes
of filming of November favorites I've
got my Canon 70d here which is what I
use for my speaking portions and also
like my sit down vlogs and yeah I use
the Canon t3i for vlogging so it's very
heavy as I've spoken about but yeah now
I'm just gonna do my makeup and just
smash out the speaking portion all right
let's do this
Ben is back from watching the Liverpool
game plus cheeky little six ones a day
oh you're making a stir-fry hearing yeah
just uh just a little bit burning in a
minute just a bit of veggies we've got

very nice we're going through it quite
quickly hi guys welcome to day three
sorry yesterday was a complete fail I
was pretty much spending the day editing
and filming and I Ben and I had dinner
and that's about it
today should be a little bit more
interesting right now I am just
uploading my November favorites I
finally finished editing it last night
so it's gonna be uploaded today in like
40 minutes my friends boo and Teresa
from dead cents are coming over to my
place to scout and I'm going to do a
fitting and yeah we're gonna film an
amazing near Z video for you guys and so
excited to film it it's going to be out
this month obviously before New Year's
Eve and I've done my workout today
already I just did a quick 30 minute
workout I did
three miles and that's it no weight
training today I'm just trying to get
back into shape they say that some our
bodies are made in the winter so I'm
working really hard okay it's finally
uploading all right so they just left my
place we've got we've got some pretty
good areas to film so I'm really excited
about that here is a really sneak peek
of the dresses that I'll be wearing in
the video but I just wanted to do a
really brief one because I don't want to
spoil it you can tell in the reflection
that I am NOT using the Canon t3i to
vlog I'm using the Sony rx100 Roman
numeral number three today and I'm using
this kind of baby tripod to really hone
everything in but yeah let me know what
you think about the quality um I have
mixed feelings about this guy here's
some goodies that I am donating it's
going to the goodwill in Glendale
somewhere wherever we are all my stuff's
going there yay
there it is IKEA or looking at the Shelf
as one of the options to put all the
shoes on but one con is that it's not
tall enough but the price is pretty damn
good isn't it yeah
$14.99 for one of these and even get
away with two and there may be another
two yeah I know huh cuz if we can have
these two shelves in the hallway and
then put a piece of artwork that would
be not bad huh it's good option I like
it
the search continues social entities yes
still contemplating about the shelf Piru
ohad shelf approaching shelf and coming
all those these ones are kind of nice
he's okay there is a shepherd light the
furnace
it's glass yeah you have to be this
black line of course you choose black um
so here is our lovely IKEA lunch I've
got ten vegan vegetable balls and a slap
of garlic bread and then Swedish
meatballs yeah we've been here about try
not to get any food ten minutes of being
here
don't move it but I would do a quick go
out for the day dresses from novella
Royale boots are from case tell me hat

mint her ass go to the gym
okay I came outside to cool down take
four miles today feel pretty damn good
huh so this part of my kitchen the
pantry I suppose has always been a mess
I try to get these two shelves on when I
first moved in and they just became an
area of clutter and don't even get me
started on their side it's always
bothered both Ben and I and Ben is
taking commission a this is what we got
from my care yesterday this little
lovely bad boy the oh my we're gonna pop
that in and try get rid of a lot of
those boxes look what we've discovered
it's a box of babies oh I've been
wondering where they all were Wow so
many so here's an update I finished up
my makeup
and it's just even more clever I had a
huge obsession or I had a moment where I
felt like I wanted to
Tupperware everything I was gonna start
to meal prep but I never worked out and
then I also found this box filled with
all my UC Davis stuff I just don't even
know what I don't know I feel like I
spent so much money on school I just
feels like a waste to just throw all
these away all right so as Ben is
starting out the pantry he's basically
doing all the shelving work so I thought
it would be a good time to do my nails
because kind of a mess right now I'm
going to an event later tonight so I
want my my nails to to be presentable
I'm just going to remove what I have on
my nails right now using the CVS polish
remover it's the one with gelatin and
it's the strengthening formula I haven't
even decided a color I'm stuck on these
to finish my nails I ended up just going
with cabana boy it's actually looking
beautiful pearly white I freaking love
it and then for my topcoat I just put on
my trusty butter LONDON hardware coat
this is I really like this one a
Nessie's topcoat but this is something
that just really really does not chip
and it dries pretty fast so I just went
with old faithful now I just have to
wait for this to dry all right guys are
you ready for the big reveal
pantry 2.0 thanks to the lovely Ben whoa
oh my gosh it looks so amazing
holy crap look at that Omar in action
yeah my mother got the big ol Martha be
tempted a little bit of a bar finger yes
in a bit of Manliness even a rose a
champagne Wow look at that it looks so
beautiful
thank you for sorting out the pantry
special now we've got a pantry that we
don't have to constantly make sure we
keep the door I know every time Jessica
more like wait make sure the pantry
doors are closed absolutely sir
this
yeah we're very excited very very hungry
so we have ordered a pizza and you order
the burrito bowl
go ahead
I'm a ghost get that son out of your
face this is just a bad spot to be in
yeah all right so we had the swings just
going to edit the video now that should
be out tonight just trying to avoid the
Sun okay is we did a good job Janice
thank you good thank you still getting
some content while editing is our
subjects sometimes I don't know how
daily bloggers do it it's it's a lot of
work okay go through alright so we just
wrapped up at the springs didn't finish
editing yet but we got a table and OOTD
before the Sun Goes Down in attempts to
buy the bridge which you know it can be
hard because there's a lot of cars going
oh yeah get it right and get a lovely
foot I know it's worth the rest once
alright guys this is the last clip that
I'm going to add for December 4th it's a
shame because I'm actually going to at
the colour-pop party tonight but I don't
think I'd be able to go film that then
come back home and then edit that into
this video and then upload it after I've
had a couple drinks I just don't see
that happening so I'm just gonna end it
