- Hey everyone.
It's your girl Jenn
and today I am talking about
10 of my favorite movies of all time.
Obviously, you don't need to
watch these before you die.
I just thought it would tie in really well
with my favorite books video.
After I uploaded that, a lot of you guys
were requesting a movie version,
so here I am, filling that.
It was freaking hard to narrow
it down to 10, but I did.
These are all movies
that have changed my life
or I just thoroughly enjoyed.
So let's get started with he countdown.
At the top of the list
I have Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind.
This has been my favorite
movie, since I was 15
and it's always such a pain to say it,
because the title's so long,
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,
but it is still my favorite film today.
I've seen it a million times
and I never get sick of it,
because this love story
is so freakin' real.
It's about a couple
named Joel and Clementine
and one day Joel wakes up and he realizes
that Clementine has completely erased him
and the relationship from her mind
and obviously, he's
really confused and hurt
and so he decides to get
that same procedure done
and erase her from his memories.
And so you see the whole process
of them removing the memories.
At the beginning of the film
you don't really know
their relationship at all,
but as they're removing each memory,
one by one, you see how they fell in love
and how they fell apart.
During heartbreak,
sometimes you're tempted
to think, you know, I wish I could just
erase this freakin' person from my mind,
but you see, in the film, that sometimes
it doesn't really work that way.
And maybe sometimes it's better
that you have those memories,
because you could learn from them.
But yeah, it is my favorite film,
very thought provoking, super surreal.
I love the visuals of the film
and it's at the top of my list.
Coming in at number two
I have the film Rushmore.
I have always been a huge
fan of Wes Anderson films,
but this is my favorite one by far.
Part of the reason why I love it
is because it's set in a
private school setting.
I've always enjoyed that setting,
because maybe when I was younger
I always wanted to go to private school.
It's about a gifted
student named Max Fischer
and he is very, very
involved in the school.
He's the president of all the clubs,
like in a million
extracurricular activities,
but unfortunately his
grades don't reflect that,
because he's too busy
exhausting his energy
on everything else.
But basically he needs
to get his act together.
But he ends up falling in
love with a teacher at school
and wooing here becomes
his main objective.
And I love Max Fischer,
because he is a character
that really gets whatever he wants,
or almost whatever he wants,
because he's so confident
and he's just like a bullshit talker.
He's just this je ne sais quo to him
and I love the dynamic
between all the characters.
It's just like a bizarre love triangle.
You'll see.
Next up, I have a very
enlightening movie for you.
It is called Fantastic Planet.
I first saw this in college
and it's one of those movies
where after you watch it
you're like, whoa life
man, because it really
shakes up your perspective of the world.
It's about a planet where big,
giant aliens are the rulers
and they take humans captive
and humans are just like little pets.
They're domesticated.
They're just for the
amusement of the aliens
and one day one of the
little humans runs away
and he discovers a world
where there's like other
humans living a civilization.
It's just a really trippy film
and I just love the animation.
It's very old school sci-fi cartoons.
It was made in the 70s and oh,
it's also completely in French,
so I highly recommend you
watch the French version
with English subtitles,
because the dubbed English
just sounds bizarre.
It's just a preference thing.
I believe you can watch it on YouTube.
You can rent it.
I'll leave a link down
below, if I can find it.
So go check it out.
Moving on, I have The Holy Mountain.
This is probably one
of the most fucked up,
but visually entrancing films
I've ever seen in my entire life.
Some parts were kind of hard to see,
because they're very graphic, gory,
a lot of nudity, but I just
couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
It's insane.
It was kind of like watching
this really crazy dream unfold
and I love that if you pause
at any moment of the film
it's something beautiful or very intense.
It makes you feel some type of way
and I feel like that's what art is about.
It's supposed to evoke
a feeling out of you,
whether it's joy or whether
it makes you uncomfortable.
This is one of my favorite films
to discuss with other
people, because I love
hearing their interpretations of it.
It's coded with symbolism.
For me, I thought that this film was about
realizing that the world is
just a projection of images
and you are the director
behind the screen.
This film is a psychedelic masterpiece
and I highly recommend you watch it.
Not for the faint of heart though.
If you are looking for like
a happy, easygoing film
probably wouldn't watch it.
Coming in at number five,
I have The Shining by Stanley Kubrick.
I normally am not a huge
fan of horror films,
but this movie is just a
complete exception for me.
It is about a tortured writer
who decides to caretake this big hotel
that is very, very isolated
and he takes his wife
and his son there and his son
starts to see weird things at the hotel.
He starts to see previous
guests that stayed there
and just really freaky stuff
that happened in the past.
Jack Nicholson's
performance is outstanding.
He plays a crazy guy so well.
It's insane.
There are iconic scenes in that film
that will never be taken out of my brain.
For example, I love the
Grady twins in the hallway
and the woman in the tub.
That was freaking freaky.
I think it's a really awesome
time to watch it as well,
because it's like Halloween.
It's a little spooky, so go check it out.
My next film favorite is Donnie Darko.
This will always have such
a soft spot in my heart,
because it pretty much encapsulates
how I felt during my teenage angsty years.
It's about a troubled
boy named Donnie Darko.
He's played by Jake Gyllenhaal.
He was so moody and so fine,
but he survives this freak accident
and since then he starts
seeing weird visions,
particularly this man in
a bunny suit named Frank.
And Frank is the one
that kinda persuades him
to do all this gnarly stuff.
It's very thought provoking, open ended
and I feel like it could be a hit or miss
with a lot of people, because some people
might watch it and be like,
"What was the point of that",
and other people would be like,
"Didn't you see, the
point is right there".
I think this is one of
the first films I saw
that just got me hooked
into the sci-fi genre.
Next up I have The Matrix.
I would say this is probably the only film
you should watch before you die,
because if you haven't you
are severely missing out.
I first saw this film
when I was in fifth grade.
I had no idea what I
was getting myself into.
My brother put it on the TV
and I was just like watching
and slowly my mind started to enlighten
and absorb what was actually
happening on the screen.
The matrix is about a man
who's just living his ordinary life
and one day he is
presented with a question
whether he wants to live
and continue his normal life
or find out the truth
and obviously he picks the truth
and it just unravels the fact
that the world is just
a simulation of images.
I believe it's a depiction of
Plato's The Allegory of the Cave
and it does such a cool
job explaining that.
It's honestly the movie
that got me into sci-fi.
I thought it was Donnie Darko,
but The Matrix was actually the movie
that just like broadened my horizons
and made me think of
things in a different way.
Next up I have a
lighthearted film for you.
It' is called Wayne's World.
I grew up listening to rock music
and Wayne's World was a film
that really incorporated
the rock and roll lifestyle
with comedy.
And it's about two dudes
that love rock music
and they have a TV show where
it's on public access network,
but basically that show
starts to get some traction
and you get to just follow their story.
And it's one of those really lighthearted,
goofy, silly movies that doesn't
take itself too seriously.
This movie is the reason why I know
the entire lyrics for Bohemian Rhapsody.
That scene is just iconic
and it's probably the first of it's kind
for carpool karaoke.
So go check it out, if
you want a good laugh.
Now I'm gonna bring the mood back down.
My next film is Mysterious Skin.
This is a very disturbing
yet touching film.
It follows the story of two boys
that have undergone something
very, very traumatic in their childhood.
And you just see how they
both cope with the abuse.
One of them is just obsessed
with space and aliens
and abductions and the other
becomes a male prostitute.
So it's a very sad story,
but it's very engaging.
It is like a very interesting
coming of age story.
I don't know.
I feel like some people might find it
really difficult to
watch, so maybe check out
the subject matter before you watch it.
My last film is Ex Machina.
I wanted to pick something
that was a little more current,
because a lot of my picks are throwbacks.
But this was released in 2015
and I actually saw this in
theaters, which was insane.
My jaw was dropped the entire time.
I couldn't believe my eyes, honestly.
It was a really haunting cool storyline,
very visually pleasing.
It's about a programmer
who is interacting with
artificial intelligence
and it's in the form
of this gorgeous robot lady.
Her face is just like a woman,
but her body is a robot.
And the programmer needs to decide
whether this AI is conscious or not.
And it just raised a lot
of questions in my head.
After I saw it, I was like
I just kept on thinking about it for days.
It's one of those films
that just like kind of
eat away at you, but I would recommend it.
I have always found AI so fascinating,
so this checks all my boxes.
All right guys, those are my
top ten favorite films of all time.
As you can tell, I am a huge sucker
for psychological sci-fic thrillers.
I just really enjoy watching things
that make me question my life
and just like blow my mind.
I do like watching
lighthearted stuff as well,
but it just didn't make
my top ten, you know.
It would mean a lot to me if
you wrote down your favorite film
in the comments down below.
I'd love to hear your guys' suggestions.
Also I wanted to apologize for the light,
because I decided to
film this at like 5:30
and now the sun's setting and my mic died
and that just set me back.
Yeah, it's been a
struggle filming this one,
but I'm glad I did.
Thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye.
(kiss)
