hey what's up it's John I am doing my
February favorites today which is a
video where I'll recap all things that I
loved last month I have been loving to
do a really heavy dark smoky eye and
pairing it with a really simple nude lip
and one of my favorite nude shades has
been NARS is Belle de Jour I originally
got it in a lip pencil form but I
realized that I was a little bit too
high-maintenance because I was using it
every single night and just sharpening
the crap out of it so I thought I would
just kind of go balls to the wall and
splurge on the actual lipstick tube and
yes the formula is a little bit
different the lip pencil is a lot more
matte while the lipstick has a really
shiny gloss finish and this new chain
has been amazing to really allow my eyes
to really pop and it doesn't wash my
face out for my book recommendation I
finished damned by Chuck Palahniuk and I
just bought it randomly at a bookstore
called Mohs in Berkeley and it was a
super fast read it's about a 13 year old
girl in the Madison and her experience
in hell and before you think that this
is like a satanic and scary book it's
really not it's actually like a really
hilarious diary entry from a really
spoiled girl the book is very
tongue-in-cheek which is expected an
opponent of noble and all his characters
are filled with like attitude they're
super sassy especially Madison she makes
a group of friends in hell and it's just
kind of like The Breakfast Club in the
sense that there is the joke because
there is the beauty there's the rebel
and so you just kind of follow them
along through Madison's eyes and yeah
just kind of see what happens one scent
that I've been rocking non-stop has been
Jo Malone's
nectarine blossom and honey perfume I
picked it up at the JFK Airport while I
was killing time I saw it's the perfect
citrus and sweet smell but it's not
really overbearing it's actually quite
subtle this fragrance is extremely
difficult to overdo because even if you
spray like five or six times it's gonna
wear off within two to three hours which
is definitely a con because it is such a
splurge but I've just been dealing with
it by just putting the actual bottle in
my
purrs to freshen up whenever it wears
off a piece of jewelry that I have been
grabbing for every outfit imaginable has
been my metal bead bib necklace that I
got her Urban Outfitters
I even wore this thing when I went
hiking a Muir was which wasn't exactly
the best idea but I just learned to look
fly while I was walking around the woods
and I think this necklace is a perfect
way to jazz up any plain tea or a
button-down or even a sweater because I
think the gold is the right shade
because it's not so gaudy and bright
it's more of like a toned down gold
slash brass color for my film
recommendation I have Alfred Hitchcock's
vertigo and this was actually my second
Hitchcock film that I saw the first one
was rear window which was amazing but
vertigo just takes the cake it's about a
next detective who's hired to spy on his
friend's wife because she's been acting
extremely unusual and I'm just gonna
leave it at that because I do not want
to give out any spoilers one of the many
reasons why I love this movie was
because it was filmed in San Francisco
so it was super trippy to see what the
city looked like in the late 50s and a
lot of the locations they shot were
places that I frequent all the time so I
got a huge kick out of that
San Francisco was one of the first
cities that I fell in love with like
deep down inside like I don't know I
just have an attachment to the city
during February my nail game changed I
decided to upgrade and get some butter
LONDON products I have been loving the
nail foundation for my base coat when
you apply it there's a pale peach coat
so it acts like a great base for
anything for my top coat I've been using
butter London's hardware which is like a
quick top coat I used to use Sally
Hansen's insta-dry which is good because
it would dry your nails in a second but
it chipped way way too fast I would say
that my nails now last like a week
without chipping which is great so those
are all my favorites if anything is
inspiring you at the moment feel free to
leave it in the comments down below by
the way I think my last favorites I had
mentioned that I was trying out some
different TV shows where I was like
looking for a new TV show to get
attached to thank you everyone who
mentioned house of cards because I am
completely sucked into that show so I
guess that's another favorites of mine
for February but it's really bleeding
into this month if you have a Twitter or
around my username is I'm genom you can
follow me there if you'd like and I will
see you my next one bye
