hi everyone it's Jen you made it to
August favorites 2013 I've got a lot of
stuff not really I have a moderate
amount of stuff to share with you so
let's begin with number one as much as
I've always wanted to be part of the
whole arm candy movement ok just
stacking a bunch of bracelets on your
arms I had never really been an active
member because bracelets were something
I never really gravitated towards it's
I've always wanted to get into it but I
realized I kept losing everything
because I didn't have proper storage for
my bracelets so now I thought I jumped
the gun and get a bracelet holder
display thing on eBay and it's kind of
changed my life in the past two weeks so
this is what happened whoo and now I
even organized them from gold and silver
to the top ones where I pick out the
ones that I just naturally pick and like
the most and now I'm really excited to
see what my whole bracelet collection is
going to evolve into if you've watched
my 50 facts about me tag you already
know that I can smell a photo booth a
mile away and this month in particular I
potatoes hopefully photos because I've
been at places with a photo booth
machine-like staff we tour humped the
elbow room and dear mom in San Francisco
and then I beautycon so they had to
photo booth machines one on industry
night and one an actual beautycon I
can't wait to kind of put them all my
fridge I'm gonna do a DIY on what I'm
going to do to kind of revamp your
fridge or the exterior of a fridge so
stay tuned for that DIY too because that
should be out sometime next week when my
magnet stickers arrive next favorite is
an old polish that I rediscovered in my
nail polish collection it's crowded
fireman Outfitters and it's kind of just
a periwinkle nail color with more of an
undertone of purple I think it goes
really well with the slight tag I've
acquired over the past
two months so I'm really feeling it I
saw Sammy a k-beauty crush wear a color
similar to this in one of her videos and
I think that's what inspired me to kind
of paint my nails this way so thanks
Sammy and hi if you're watching so I
have a movie recommendation it is an old
90s flick called The Fifth Element it's
pretty much classic but it was my first
time seeing this month and I'm so glad I
did because it was incredible it's a
sci-fi film based in the future and the
whole universe is coming to an end but
there's one hope and it's The Fifth
Element and what really did it for me
was the costume design Jean Paul Gautier
designed the entire wardrobe and that
explains why it was absolutely
impeccable and sexy at the same time
everyone was dressed amazing down to the
flight attendants the Macdonald workers
to Lulu duh
especially Lulu I mean now I know
exactly who I want to be for Halloween
and I've already ordered a portion of my
costume online so I'm really excited I
realized that I needed some shoes that I
could just kind of slip in and out of
really easily and a sensible person
would have just gotten flip-flops but I
went the extra mile and I got these Doc
Martens / Birkenstocks fusion it looks
like a Birkenstock but in the eyes of
Doc Martin I got them in white because
I'm in my white shoes phase right now
they remind me of the sandals that my
dad wears to the beach and I love
everything about them down to the fact
they make my feet look huge and wide
whatever I think they're stupid comfy
and I think they look cool my last
favorite is a book and it is Empire
Falls by Richard Russo this was actually
a sign to me my senior year of high
school
and I never read it I was definitely one
of those kids who just kind of went on
spark notes or cliff notes and just kind
of regurgitated a Frankenstein of the
notes and just things that I would pop
out of the book naturally but anyway I
went to my parents house in SoCal this
month and I saw this book lying around
and I thought I'd pick it up because it
won a Pulitzer Prize so you know I just
thought I'd give it a second chance and
I'm so glad I did because it's a really
good book to just get lost in it's about
a small town
and people live there and you just
really really get inside their heads and
they kind of just come to life they're
real they're hypocritical and most of
all they're relatable and so the whole
character development in this book is
just amazing if I had to pick my
favorite characters would be mrs.
whiting because she's the boss and maybe
John Vause because he's just kind of the
oddball in town so those were all my
August favorites
once again this month went by really
really fast if any of these kind of
struck a nerve on you or you want to
comment on something just write it down
below I would love to read it or if
nothing kind of struck out you can also
just write a normal comment and I would
love to read it
if you have an Instagram my username is
I'm dronin you can follow me if you'd
like but not it's totally cool as well
so with that being said I guess that's
it and I'll see you next time bye
