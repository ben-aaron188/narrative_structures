what's up I'm John today I'm doing the
closet confidential tag which is a
series of questions about your wardrobe
I was tagged by the lovely Miss Essie
button so thank you so much for tagging
me so let's get started with the first
question
I was originally going to show you my
old spongebob t-shirt that I got when I
was 8 years old in Las Vegas but I can't
seem to find it right now but here's an
old photo of me wearing it at the gym so
I'm going to show you my second oldest
item in my closet
I stole it from my brother's closet when
I was 11 years old and this is when I
was just kind of experimenting with more
of a edgier style I suppose it's just a
pale yellow graphic tee with this really
gory woman walking some Dalmatians it's
a really intense t-shirt and I just
thought I was just so cutting edge
wearing this to school and my brother
James would scold me every single time
he saw me wear that shirt he was just
kind of like why did you take that from
my closet my newest item is this
semi-sheer crop top by thea by thora
they're based in Thailand but they ship
internationally and I love this shirt
because it is so luxurious and well made
there's so much depth in this top with
subtle bubbles and the shadows down the
middle I think it's perfect to wear with
some classic black skinnies for the
remaining of winter and once spring
rolls around I can switch it up with
some white squirts or something I don't
have a clothing item that is designer
per se but I do have these Kenzo boots
that I got as a gift from New York
Fashion Week thank you so much hungry I
freaking love these boots they're
amazing I think the squared-off toe
makes the shoe really unisex meaning a
boy or a girl could totally rock these I
would have to say my crop to long-sleeve
that I got at forever 21 I think it was
around $8 at max this top is perfect
because I have a tendency to wear a lot
of cropped things even in the wintertime
and this shirt acts as a good first base
to help me keep myself insulated
hands-down my vintage Pink Floyd tee I
got it at the Rose Bowl flea market
I think I was around like nineteen years
old I was digging through two huge piles
of clothing and I was just kind of
ravaging each item and then I just
happen to follow along the Pink Floyd
tea and like my heart just kind of
stopped when I asked the guy how much it
was gonna be I was easily expecting
around $50 because that's how expensive
panties are sometimes and he just said
two bucks and I don't know I just I
couldn't explain to you how a B was so I
gave him the $2 bills and I bounced out
of there and it is still one of my
favorite pieces today it's probably this
green leather jacket that I got online I
honestly have no idea what I was
thinking when I put it in my online cart
I think that's one of the cons of online
shopping because it's very very
impulsive I had this vision that I was
gonna like DIY and put like a sick patch
in the back and make it really punk rock
but it ended up being a little bit too
cropped and like shoulder pads are a
little bit deceiving and I don't know I
have no inclination to wear it right now
maybe I'll just let it age in my claws a
little bit more and get inspired another
time I think this is the question that
Estee added to the series and I love it
because it's very tricky because I feel
as if if I show you something that I
love I feel at least one person will
like it with me I would have to say my
mom jeans I got these from Urban
Outfitters they're from the bdg line and
I freaking love them I think they're a
really fun and casual piece to wear
around the streets you don't see these
quite that often I mean you see these
less than skinny jeans and leggings and
so I think it's really fun to play with
difference to the what's on your body
number one my Warriors beanie because I
got about the bay and it keeps my head
warm number two is my white mesh top it
has Hawaii in it and it makes me really
excited because I just booked my tickets
to Maui for the end of April and I am so
leaving this vacation I want to travel
somewhere where it's warm so if you're
from Hawaii and you're watching and
you're from Maui let me know what things
I should do looking for something that
involves hiking number three has got to
be my gold slash brass Doc Martens
they are
frickin awesome and they are also very
uncomfortable I really hope it's an
issue about just like breaking them in
with some thick socks I don't know I'll
keep you guys posted so those are all
the questions if you're watching this
please feel free to enter them as well
either through a video or through the
comments down below and I also tagged
these people I hope you enjoyed the
video and I will catch you next one bye
