Hey
hi Jen welcome to the March hall be
prepared this is going to be a pretty
big one let's start things off nice and
slow we're going to begin with eBay
I love distressed objects I like things
that are ripped and kind of Daryll each
if you will and so when I saw this black
distressed hoodie on eBay I had to get
it it's cropped and it's got these
shreds all along it it's got one on the
hood and the chest and the back I think
this is the perfect item for a I guess
which he voodoo spring piece the next
items are from thread sons first off I
have this lace top as you can see I'm a
total fiend for lace I'm wearing a lace
top even right now but this one
sleeveless and this one has long sleeves
to be more specific this one has bell
sleeves so it's got a really romantic
60s airy vibe but instead of being too
feminine it has the black embroidery on
the sleeves and on the bottom as well so
it kind of toughen it up I think denim
shorts are a spring and summer must-have
and you can't get enough I'm holding
these denim shorts I think they're quite
different because it has this really
interesting geometric art deco design on
the crotch area and so I think that's
what sets it apart from other denim
shorts I think that these are gently
acid-washed I wouldn't say they're
full-blown but definitely some
distressed discoloration on it I'm
always looking for interesting bracelets
to Paulo my arms and I thought this kind
of rustic
orange I guess chain braided bracelet
was the perfect touch because it's going
to go really well with when I wear other
goals and bronze items on my outfit and
I really appreciate that there is a
clasp so you can adjust how small you
want it most bracelets are far too big
on me especially the ones that furbish
me one which I find extremely
aggravating because I'll see a really
cute bracelet and I won't be able to
wear it because I can't adjust it so I
really appreciate it when it comes with
that option to you know have it fit you
moving on to choice comm I think
got this black vertical striped crop top
and this was actually a long shirt but I
just hacked it off because I wasn't
digging how long it was and because it's
such a boxy fit I just rolled up the
sleeves and now it looks awesome I've
always been really attracted to the
black flag design t-shirt but I didn't
feel comfortable wearing it because if I
wore a black flag t-shirt someone would
ask oh so what's the river album by
Black Flag and I wouldn't have an answer
and I personally don't wear panties of
bands I don't listen to because I just
want to avoid that situation altogether
and I don't want to mislead them this
shirt kind of solves my whole black flag
dilemma by wearing something that's the
one to design but I don't necessarily
have to listen to the band and just a
disclaimer I'm not bashing people that
wear band tees that they don't listen to
if you like the design that's totally
cool and if that shirt makes you feel
good dude more power to you but it's my
own personal choice to wear band T's of
bands that I actually listen to boom
moving on to my monthly march plunder
pieces I picked out six more items to
show you guys I'm holding this fringe
black top and it's very reminiscent of
the 20s because of the little tassels
but it's interesting because they have
these little gold baubles that just add
an extra dimension of glamour to it and
if you've always been kind of
apprehensive about wearing cropped tops
because you don't want to bare your
belly I think that this is a good
alternative because it's cropped but the
fringe kind of hide your stomach so you
still get the illusion that you're a
crop top but you don't feel as exposed
moving on to my next piece I'm holding
this black lace kind of overthrow it's
kind of like a cropped black kimono I
guess this is gonna be great for evening
wear because if you wear this with the
black fringe tops and I just showed you
it creates a really I don't know elegant
and glamorous look that looks just very
effortless I love wearing sure items all
year maybe in the winter not so much but
spring is back in the shear items are in
full force I'm holding this pale pink
sheer drop tank and I call it a drop
tank
the back of it just drops to the floor
it's extremely long and it just leads
into a gorgeous flowy train that's gonna
look amazing when the wind hits it I've
been on a search for just a really long
oversized cardigan and so when I saw
this cardigan on the site I just about
died because it is everything that I've
been looking for it is this creme
crochet knit and it just hits my legs
and it's oversized but the sleeves are
quite fitted so that way I just don't
get lost in the fabric I'm adding yet
another crop top to my vast collection
and this one is in this nice Sienna
color and it's slightly ruffled which is
awesome for the people in the itty bitty
titty committee because small tips look
great in ruffles and long loose tanks or
in my opinion I think they look great I
get like a really Forest nymph II vibe
from it because of the color and just
tell effortless the silhouette is I am a
very proud advocate for speckled knits
and this knit stuck with cardigan is no
exception it's black and I think I'm
really drawn to this pattern because it
kind of reminds me of like the
television static that we saw when we
were younger when we didn't have cable
I just think has like a really retro
feel to it I added some I or added one
button and I got this one at the Alameda
flea market it's just a cute little
smiley face and overall I think it's
just gonna be a great layering piece for
just casual outfits that I feel like
wearing so the plunder haul is now
finished we're now moving on to Lulu's
territory I got these lace shorts and I
think lace shorts are a must-have for
the spring because they just act as a
really good balance when you're wearing
really tough materials like leather and
and the print for this is really cute
because they're little white daisies all
along the shorts speaking of white
frilly things I am holding this cream
crochet bag and as fringe all along the
end and I guess it's pretty much like a
fancy tote bag you can use this on a
school bag because you can fit at least
three notebooks and a textbook depending
on how big your textbooks are overall
it's just like a bucket bag where
and justify your stuff in for school or
the beach or I don't know just an
everyday purse I guess so I have a love
and hate relationship with leotards
let's stop for the love I guess I love
them because you don't have to tuck
anything in you don't have to worry
about weird bumps because it just all
seamlessly goes in
I hate leotards because going pee in
them just sucks cuz have to strip down
in a restroom it's really gross but when
a leotard has a crotch snap I guess
that's a good color or a snatch snap
because you can just snap it open and
you can relieve yourself without
stripping down it's quite important
anyway besides the snap part I love how
this is off the shoulders and it's black
and super Lacy I know it's kind of vampy
for spring but I I think evening wear
it's gonna look awesome vertical stripes
are a trend that I'm really liking right
now and if you're nervous about wearing
you know full-blown striped pants you
can just kind of ease into it with some
striped shorts I'm holding these strap
shorts from obey and they're quite
beachy because they have this little
drawstring on it and they just look like
beachwear I think the stripes make it
very nautical I also snuck some
accessories from Lulu's I picked up this
evil eye bracelet and unfortunately it's
not adjustable so I can either wear it
like this quite low on the wrist or I
can kind of shift it up to the middle of
my forearm
you tell me which one looks better but
either way I think the design looks cool
I picked out this sweater and I'm gonna
call it the labyrinth sweater because of
the very intricate minimalist line
design and it's quite fuzzy and it's a
very boxy fit but the sleeves are fitted
which is very important because then you
don't get drowned in your fabric and I
don't know if this was intentional or
not but you can also reverse it and have
it be a white geometric sweater so it's
kind of like two sweaters in one my next
item is this ruffles off the shoulder
black top it is me out of this really I
guess that like that windbreaker
material and so it's gonna be very
cooling for the warmer months and it's
quite you know oversized on the top and
just very very slimming on the bottom so
it's a very interesting silhouette which
I can appreciate last series of items
are from daily look and they completely
revamp their website so shopping on it
is a lot easier you don't have to look
at the different outfits that they
created for you you can just browse
through it like a normal clothing site
right now so finding items is a breeze I
wanted to get a dress that was gonna be
really good for formal occasions or the
spring and summer so I thought this
white laser cutout dress is gonna be
perfect usually when I see laser cutouts
it's mostly on like black pleather so
it's really really refreshing to see it
on this beautiful white starched out
material and the cutouts are all collar
the sleeves the waist and on the trim it
as well I'm super excited to just glam
this up with gold or bronze accessories
and the last item is something that I'm
wearing right now it's the shaggy taupe
cardigan I love texture because it just
adds so much of a room to your outfit I
know this texture is in everyone's cup
of tea it kind of looks like a cocker
spaniel but I think all Chris phones are
cute and I like this texture so okay the
haul is over if you made it this long
congratulations I firmly shake your hand
