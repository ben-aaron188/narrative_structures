hi guys I'm back and I've teamed up with
target to give you some pointers on
wearing denim because let's be real
wearing denim can be tricky from finding
the right fit to styling them so I
whipped up five tips so let's get
started I think the biggest issue on
finding denim that looks good on you is
finding one that you know hits you at
the right length so if you're short like
me try and find an inseam that is pretty
low so what does that target the lowest
in seen that I can find was 28 inches
and that actually fits me perfectly as
you can see these denim jeans right here
they don't ball up and curl up in a
really strange way they're just the
right length so if you're tall try and
find an inseam that's higher if you're
shorter find one that's lower once you
find the denim that's the perfect length
for you you can really style it up in
whatever way you want for my look I just
went for a casual look and then to add a
little bit of spice I wore my
heart-shaped choker and I feel like that
just kind of tied in the whole look
together boyfriend jeans are one of my
favorite trends in denim right now
they're just so laid back effortless and
just ridiculously comfortable and when
I'm looking for the right pair of
boyfriend jeans I always like to make
sure I feel the texture of the jeans
because I personally don't like the look
or feel of stiff and baggy denim I don't
think it's really flattering to my
figure so that's why when I find
boyfriend jeans I always make sure I
feel the texture and make sure it's soft
loose and flexible I also like to roll
up the cuffs and flash a bit of ankle
because I feel like a dainty little
ankle counters the badness of the Jean
every now and again I like to bust out
the Canadian tuxedo and for those who
don't know what that means it means
wearing denim on denim on denim and I
find that a lot people are intimidated
by this look because it's a little bit
too bold and they think that they can't
pull it off but yes believe me you can
totally pull it off my main trick with
wearing denim on denim is to just wear a
wash that's different from my all denim
look I wore two different washes for the
inside I went for like a light wash
theme and then I broke it all apart by
wearing my boyfriend denim jacket that's
darker I think this is just a really
simple and casual way to wear denim on
dead
without looking too cray I love being
able to customize my jeans I find that
it gives you the ability to express
yourself and get a little bit creative
and for this pair of jeans I basically
just cut them into denim shorts with
some scissors and then I rolled up the
cuffs to give it a more finished look I
also decided to add some patches to add
some personality and I decided on this
whimsical Y patch because why not
it adds a punch of color and it makes my
bottoms into something very statement I
think that this look is probably my most
quirky out of the bunch
I wore my rainbow swirl top to
coordinate with the colorful patch and
then taught my look off with a fun pink
visor because it's always great to have
like your own personal batch of shade my
last tip is to play around with
different denim silhouettes these days
pretty much any article of clothing can
come in denim and so when I saw these
denim joggers I was shocked and also
very excited because I had never seen a
pair like these before and it made me
really happy because wearing joggers is
basically wearing comfy sweatpants that
you can lounge around at home and then
immediately go out and run errands or
eat a fancy brunch and I felt these
joggers with a white button-down to just
elevate the ensemble and I also pull the
Jungers up to my cap to make them look
more lived-in I just love the fact that
I'm able to stay chic and comfortable at
the same time so those are my five tips
on wearing denim by genom and I want to
thank Target for sponsoring this video
and letting me use their jeans I
absolutely love the fact that I was able
to still Express my style to the fullest
