hi guys it feels so amazing to be back
home but funny enough I am leaving again
I'm heading out to Dubai and I am so
pumped to go
the Dubai Tourism Board invited me so I
I don't know how this happened but I am
so grateful to be going I know it's back
to back but I'm glad I had today to kind
of just settle down a little bit repack
got some stuff done I'm going to Dubai
with Ashley who is my manager and I'm
just so excited to spend some extra time
with her and Ben is staying here
obviously to take care of cheeky and
obviously to see what happens with his
wrist it took about three hours to pack
this I do not know why it took so long
to pack everything but it's done I'm
going to miss you guys
breath Airport now we're all checked in
I have my little San Pellegrino here the
flight is at 9:30 and we land in Dubai
at 1:30 a.m. so it's going to be quite
the time difference the flight I believe
is 16 hours and then some so we're gonna
be up in there for a little bit I'm
super excited to head on over we have
like a list of activities every day some
of these super jump ups so I'm stoked
somehow anything is so easy this is when
it eats at your little bed over here we
drove the screen we've got a little
skincare station over here write some
notes here Oh boss can't look at stats
nice little Sagar minibar and a
touchscreen that controls everything
this is amazing I don't have any words
to be honest and speechless
good morning you guys we are officially
in Dubai it's our first day we landed
around 2:30 a.m. and then we just tried
our best to sleep we're just too excited
to sleep to be honest but now it is 8
a.m. we're gonna have breakfast and our
hotel is literally breathtaking there's
a canal out here there's a bunch of
trees beautiful tiling everywhere so
much detail and so we're really excited
aside the day my curler actually broke
because it's not compatible with the
voltage so I'm just gonna grab a new one
and that's why my hair is in these
pigtails for now let's have some
breakfast now I've got a smorgasbord of
random stuff not a little mini pizza
because it was an option gonna dig in no
really
you
so here we are at the Bush Khalifa and
around the 154th five-story 848 story
and this is the tallest the Ashton I
could have ever been awesome time
there's no quinn wearing heels today but
we did it without even be tall yeah
pretty much
so right now we're having lunch at the
Armani hotel I started off with a salad
reading the side and then gonna dive
into the recipe booth later having
dessert now and I'm obsessed with
amounts of dates in this city I love
dudes I didn't know how we talked about
dates until I came here
as she won't eat it she thinks is too
ugly
good morning everyone it is day to Dubai
winter here is so beautiful it's like a
really nice temperature it's a good 75
right now yesterday we had such a
jam-packed one it was so much fun though
I think I was like the best way to deal
with jet lag because there was no time
to be tired I also got some great news
back at home Ben does not need surgery
on his wrist thank God and I want to
thank everyone who sent in their well
wishes their prayers their good thoughts
everything because clearly it worked in
I'm just
oh so grateful that he doesn't need it
is just a huge weight off our backs and
yeah he just needs to be in the cast for
another six weeks and he loved his
respect so really happy about that just
in a good mood today we already had
breakfast and I think now we're just
going to take a couple pictures around
the resort starting the day off with
high tea at the Fuji log this is gonna
be the most extensive tea course ever
had this is a total of seven courses I'm
so excited
I got my tea at the Darjeeling Cheers
well done the grand finale
three tiers of amazingness
good morning guys so yesterday was a
little bit of a fail in vlogging after
tea I just forgot my camera in the room
and then we went to the beach and then
we got our nails done I just got a nice
glittery gel nail but for some reason
this took two and a half hours to do we
got there at 7 p.m. and we left the
salon at 9:30 it was pretty crazy but
I'm glad they look good my cuticles are
non-existent and I'm happy with them
today I'm not gonna ever get my camera
all the batteries are charged and I
believe we're going to the souk gold
souk and the spice souk so it's just
going to be like a market I believe so
I'm excited to see that part of Dubai
I've never been other than that I'm just
gonna quickly get ready and talk to you
guys in a bit
you guys this is the biggest ring in the
world obviously not for sale this is the
Guinness World Record certificate to
prove it it is lunchtime we are having
some Lebanese food it's called
fluffy for me of course we're about to
Dubai Mall
take it over it just so nice we haven't
even scratched the surface of the Dubai
Mall I got this bracelet it says Wow in
Arabic and I
hi hmm as Amy's appetizer appetizers oh
no this is just the appetizers Oh
oh my gosh so what's this one called
again top tabbouleh is it hummus almost
bread bread Oh French fries and then egg
rolls sambusa Wow yeah
where are we actually the craziest
flower garden I've ever been inside the
airplane was life-sized and covered with
flowers huh so they're not messing
around here no way I think my favorite
one was the woman who was throwing up
flowers out of her hands in her mouth
that was a personal favorite literally
they don't mess around in divine knows
what's happened yeah as well go big or
go home we have an hour to kill before
dinner so I thought that I would pop in
and upload my goodwill throwback haul
and I'm so happy this video is out if
you guys haven't seen it feel free to
open the card to watch it should be in
the corner of the screen it was just so
nostalgic building this I'm actually
seeing Sarah next week next Monday we're
having coffee so I'm really excited to
see her she lives in San Jose she's
still going to school and I live down in
LA but every time she comes down to our
hometown we always try to make an effort
to see each other so we'll see if she
makes a cameo I mean it'd be cool if we
did a video together I know that a lot
of you guys I want to get but I just
it's just hard when you don't see your
friend for a long time and then you just
you know start filming but I don't know
who knows she's gonna be in town for a
couple weeks so I think we can make it
work but yeah I'm so happy the videos
out I'm just answering comments and then
we're gonna have dinner
disaster strikes it is 120 a.m. I lost
my phone in a taxi I feel calm about it
now but that's because I had my meltdown
maybe like an hour ago
so I'm good I lost it because we went in
this taxi we assumed that we could just
pay in card because we've just been
swiping our cards left and right and
it's been fine and so we get in this
taxi and he wouldn't take our cards at
all we had no cash so we told him to
stay outside by the hotel and we went
back in the ATM gave him the cash Nate
drove off but I think I was just so
flustered with the situation that I just
never did my usual check back on the
seat see if I left anything and I think
that is what caused me to just
completely forget my phone my phone is
on airplane mode so I can't call it I
think it's a goner I've come to terms
with it I only have one day left here so
we're gonna make the most of it
I'm just trying to tell myself like at
least it's not my camera and it at least
is not my laptop that would suck oh you
guys they just found my phone you have
no idea how excited I am I really
thought I was a goner
I was just slowly coming to terms it I
just can't believe they found it so just
this hotel the service has been so
amazing and accommodating um max I
believe his name was was the first
person who wrote down all the details he
asked us all the right questions like
what time did you leave the hotel what
time do you get the cab all that stuff
he wrote it all down and then he gave it
to a person named Simon and then all
night he was working on looking at the
footage of contacting the taxi service
and he got the driver's license number
it's insane and then this morning
Marielle she took over and she handled
it and now they contacted the driver and
the driver actually like kept the phone
and is gonna return it later tonight so
I just I just can't believe it this has
been I don't know like I know it's not
that big video to lose your phone but
being in a foreign country when you
don't have your device that connected to
the world it is a little shocking you
know but that phone is back to me I'm
gonna pop in my Find My iPhone app I'm
gonna do the cloud whatever that is I
still don't understand it and then I'm
gonna pack everything up that's what I
need to do lesson learned
and we straight down I used to all the
pressure
it's here my phone is back in my hand I
literally never thought this would
happen but it did
good night hey guys so we just finished
packing up and now we're gonna head to
the airport
honestly this trip has been so amazing a
trip of a lifetime seriously I feel like
I've seen so much of do I've learned so
much as well and I just want to thank
the Dubai Tourism Board for sending us
out here like what a dream job so
