my son it's a girl Jen welcome back
today I am doing a very much anticipated
episode of what would Jen wear if you
are just tuning in this is a segment on
my channel where you tweet me your
fashion dilemma and I try my best to
answer it we are currently on the 13th
episode this is crazy of yeah we've got
a slew of fashion dilemmas and before I
get started if you are not subscribed to
my channel the button is down there hit
that become a gem today and let's get
started
Isabelle asks what would you wear for a
picnic love you in your video so much
well thank you so if you've been
watching my channel for a while then you
know how much I love picnics I just love
eating outdoors I love eating indoors
too but something about like having a
fresh breed while eating is just a
really great sensation so here is my
picnic outfit I decided to rock some
cute little overalls because they're
loose and comfortable and great on the
go underneath I wore this off the
shoulder top then I threw on a white cap
just in case the Sun is a little intense
and then I rocked these nude Adidas for
a nice sporty feel I think this outfit
is perfect for picnics because it's just
comfortable and when you are outside and
you just want to have fun outfits like
these are just perfect also I haven't
been on a picnic since Valentine's Day
so I'm definitely overdue next up I've
got a question from corn hub what would
you wear if you were in a punk music
video I love this question I thought it
was very original thank you for sending
that over so if this is my punk inspired
look for this outfit I had to bust out
this latex skirt from dolls kill I had
to skirt for like a couple of months now
but I had trouble styling it so this
question was just the perfect reason to
play around with it
I decided to wear this bright orange top
from pleasures for accessories I've
piled on the silver jewelry and then
added some fishnets to really spice it
up for shoes I just wore these boots
with stars in the back but ideally I
would have loved to worn some Doc Martin
I feel like that would been more true to
like the punk nature but I'm going to be
completely honest with you I sold all my
dog
because they were just so uncomfortable
I just didn't have the patience to break
them in I mean like I wore them a good
like five or six times but just my my
feet couldn't handle it so yeah just
imagine I'm wearing golf Martens for
this look the next tweet comes from
sugar Glo what would John wear if you
gained a little some thumb in your
midsection but still try to look cute
and sexy for the summer
lol help so I've actually lived in this
predicament last summer I gained like a
good like 10 to 15 pounds and you know I
was still filming and shooting and you
know still feeling cute in my outfits
but on days where I just felt like extra
bloated and just extra Kum Kee I would
just always go to a flowy maxi dress I
know you would feel like this wouldn't
be the item to wear when you're feeling
you know bigger but it's just so
slimming and this dress is from Mesa I
absolutely love the pattern because it
really hides every food baby and it's
just very forgiving to the body I love
the fact that this leaves are off the
shoulder so it adds a little coverage to
the arms and the elastic part in the
stomach gives more shape to the body I
decided to wear some comfortable heels
with this list because height always
counteracts any extra pounds and then I
wrapped these fun bauble earrings to
bring more attention on the face I think
the way that you dressed yourself really
affects the way you feel in an outfit
even when I gained you know some weight
last year it was all about how an
article of clothing fit my body in the
end it's all about the fit question
number four is from space what would
Jenna wear to an art festival love you
so I think this question out because I
genuinely do want to attend in our
festival this summer so really praying
that it happened but this is my outfit
for the occasion I decided to style this
outfit around this floral off the
shoulder top with these fun billowy
sleeves I think that the use of rainbow
colors on the sleeves are a good
representation of arch where my bottoms
are marking these denim shorts and then
I threw on this woven beret because I
feel like all art connoisseurs should
honor beret it just goes hand in hand
when your particular or admiring art
just a bray really just you know ties
everything together
next dilemma comes from Jim what would
Jen wear for a stylish work wear in a
media company
I feel like media companies or even like
PR agencies you're a lot to really wear
stuff that's more relaxed and just a
little bit more modern so this is my
take on business casual I kind of met
somewhere in the middle with this black
and white ensemble I'm rocking this
lightweight pattern blazer and I feel
like it's still professional but has a
young feel to it underneath I'm wearing
a button-down it's a little sheer so if
it's too sheer for where you work
definitely wear something that's more
opaque for bottoms I'm wearing these
wack skinnies I think they're very
tailored and just streamlined look and
then I dropped the appeals from the
Coupole they are just like my most
professional shoe and yeah this is what
I would wear if I worked in an office I
have never actually worked in one but I
do visit a lot of them for my meetings
so the last question comes from Paula
she asks I'm having a hard time styling
culottes I love them but I think they
make me look shorter how can I sell them
thank you so I'm pretty short too I'm
five foot one and that doesn't stop me
from wearing culottes or whatever like
fashion trend I want to try out I think
in the end it's all about the way
something fits on you offer this outfit
I'm wearing these like wide leg bottoms
they're a little bit long to be
considered coolest but my advice for
styling both of these pieces are exactly
the same when you're dealing with a
wider bottom definitely wear something
more fitted on top if you're feeling a
little too short
always just throw on some heels that's
like an easy no-brainer solution and
since this is like the summer look I
throw on this big straw hat and wore
some gold jewelry alright guys that
