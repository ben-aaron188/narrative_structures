hi everybody
hey guys Here I am it might be on stage
my man my baby my hunk my boo scale felt
but today we are filming v my man
styled my outfit challenge I've seen
this cash circulating around the
internet and I thought it was time to do
our own spin on it just the idea of it
is stressing me out I mean for you girls
you've got so many options high-waisted
jeans skirt shorts
Carol neck just everything but guys
t-shirts and jeans maybe shorts you're
good and we thought we'd mix up and do
like a thrifted style so we're going to
go to a goodwill and I have to pick out
some outfits for Jenna this is going to
be hard yeah it's going to be good we
are here at the goodwill in Glassell
Park I'm going to get Jen three outfits
first one's going to be date tonight
the second one is going to be an
everyday Jen kind of vibe and the third
one's going to be girls night the last
one is going to be a wild card where Jen
will have to go and wear this out in
public which I'm very excited for but
obviously the you know the more
interesting and wacky I go the harder
she's going to go when it's my turn so
follow me animals we'll see
if I'm not good at shopping for myself
let alone the you in this gigantic door
dad look I think we've got too many
options you know it all business sells
as well um I like the safe without like
what yeah after no you know that feels
good I think I'm done I might have been
the most difficult our meet where we've
been here now yeah we've it ever a
really large I've we're finished
no no way is success alright guys we are
back at home all the outfits are
prepared now I was tough I was very
tough I feel confident
finish your crack on no get on Jen every
day Jennifer okay be back in it good I
love it the point of it was to go to
something comfortable the polka dot
shirt feels soft light like the shape of
that and I think the skirts just nice
and easy again that's comfortable and we
found out it's actually Schwartz what's
a cool color sport for the floor very
gory hmm and then we went for the white
tennis shoes which again comfortable
when it just says you're feeling relaxed
and casual and the headband is actually
what Jen wore on our first date the
London Eye wasn't it yeah right so that
had some nostalgic sentimental phobias
or reason for that so what would you
give that out of 10 I would give this
outfit like a good a 10 right yeah is
cute I don't think it's like for
everyday I think this is kind of like a
very feminine version of my everyday
style I would totally rock this like
this is a cute lunch outfit or on day 2
I want to look like more pure
yeah I feel very wholesome in this
outfit I like it
okay well let's see how the next one
goes why don't you try that a date night
okay okay
yep good luck oh oh oh
so with this outfit the bottoms I want
you to go to some pants of opposed to
escort me I feel like you like the shape
of those tops at the moment yeah I do
like I like a big ruffle and obviously I
am you know on the smaller side and just
makes it look more put together because
this has got a bit of a pattern to it
if it will keep it simple on tops my
silver earrings and then some nice mules
even a shawl so what do you give this
out of 10 I would give this a good night
at a time
I like how it's not like your typical
date night look looks like a little like
bodycon dress so nice twist to it I
think I would have borne it with like a
lighter bottom like I would have worn
like some on like oh wow I'm thinking it
personally I'm happy with that I've got
9 out of 10
yeah I think it's also next up we have
the girls night out
oh ah oh yeah is this one's cool
I like the little green logic wave a
jacket I mean I definitely didn't pull
that off thank you good I'll give it a
go after this movie I thought I'd do a
black skirt mix it up a little bit this
was actually a really great skirt I'm
really happy with the spine this is I
really needed like a corduroy a line
skirt so this is perfect welcome you're
welcome
nice lace top a beret of course we know
Jen really she likes Berets I do I'm in
some black Bobby mules no these are like
asleep at pointe shoes mm-hmm so that's
about it and I look at what do you think
will you rate it
I would doing this a good 9 to 10 once
again I'm happy that you went with just
kind of like a unique choice this could
have been like a sequined shiny number
but you went for something more brave
and bold my like that but that's also
why we took another too
than their so why now I discuss without
a lot of coordination when you're you're
styling outfit yeah I think it's great
good well last but not least is the wild
card this is a lot of fun to find I'm
very happy with it I think it's very
fitting and Jenny then it's got chance
got to try and make him look good and
then also she has to go out in public
and wear it which I'm very happy about
we'll see what I can do I might try
wrister to salvage it good now go get it
off that is oh my god the reason why I
picked it is just it's just not you I
mean you don't get I mean hey guys I'm
famous on the internet it's both of
those top of the screen give me
attention apology signal that does on
this topic very nice yeah you do your
own thing yeah I respect your style just
that I'm not a gender stall I know what
she likes and what she doesn't like on
herself and I think she won't like this
when she's gone out in public
