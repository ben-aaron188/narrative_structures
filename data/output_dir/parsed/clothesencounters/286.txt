I thought I would take a little break
from fashion and film something a little
bit more fun to watch this tag is about
first dates and it is a topic that I
have never spoken to you guys about so
let's get started how long does it take
you to get ready for a date it really
depends if I have already washed my hair
and then it would take me around 25 to
30 minutes five minutes to kind of
reflect in the mirror and process what
kind of look I'm going for that day and
15 minutes per application and then 10
minutes for my hair but if I'm starting
from scratch and I'm gonna take a shower
it's probably gonna take an hour what's
your idea of a perfect first date dinner
drinks cinema or an adventurous date my
perfect first date would probably be a
combination of dinner and drinks it's
just classic and it's just really
romantic and I'm a sucker for eating out
I loved the whole process and ritual of
going to a restaurant waiting for the
hostess to seat you putting a napkin on
your lap getting the menu figuring out
where you're gonna eat I just absolutely
loved it and I think grabbing food is a
great way to get to know someone
what would you gravitate more towards
two are on a date jeans trousers skirt
or a dress if we're just going to let's
say a two dollar sign restaurant on Yelp
then opt for a crop top and some denim I
would spice the fit up with some
accessories like earrings or jewelry and
some ankle boots I probably wouldn't
wear my tallest boots only because I
don't know maybe I would what makeup
would you wear girl-next-door smoky and
sexy a bold lip or brights I would
probably do an amped-up version of the
girl next door something relatively
natural like a peachy smoky eye with
some neutral lips personally I don't
want to look too done up especially for
their first date so I'd rather keep it
quite subdued maybe on the second day
I'll bring up the big guns and you know
wear something smoky and sexy but for
the first date you're gonna get a
watered-down version of it your date
says yeah half an hour to get ready what
do you do
I wouldn't go personally for the first
day I would prefer we had something
planned I don't want to have like
thinking that I'm just you know always
ready and accessible and ready to go no
you're gonna have to wait I would
probably say hey sorry I'm busy
even if I'm just on my couch watching
Netflix or something I think it just
kind of ruins the chase so I think um
declining and rescheduling is going to
leave a little bit more mystery to you
your day asks for the bill do you a
offered to pay with actual mean to pay B
make a fuss with no intention of
actually paying or C expect them to pay
right away I blow on dates expecting to
just split the bill you had your food I
had mine maybe we shared a little bit
but regardless I don't like building up
an expectation that someone is gonna pay
for me because I don't know where this
person is financially especially in this
economy and it's something that I don't
really take personally because money is
a really sensitive issue now moving on
let's say he assists on pay and he
checks my offer two or three times they
don't let him pay because I personally
don't want a weird argument where we're
just kind of tugging over the bill and
I'm like no I'll pay no I'll pay no I'll
pay you know it's that's that's not what
I want if he if he insists then you know
that's also I can't lie it does feel
nice to be treated having someone pay
for you is a gift in the end and it's
something that I do appreciate do you go
out with them again I think if we're
really clicking and reviving and we have
a really good chemistry than sure let's
do a second date but if it's an awful
day and it's just I don't know we're
just not vibing then it's probably not
gonna happen but sorry
whether you paid the dinner or not thank
you for the meal though it's time to say
goodbye you really like your date
do you wave hug kiss on the cheek Tech
or a full-on smooch I probably go for a
hug like a full embrace none of that
side hug stuff unless I really didn't
like you and if you happen to kiss me on
the cheek that I would let it happen but
god no would I start the kiss on the
cheek because I think he would see it as
an invitation that I want something more
that night don't like kissing on the
first date because I think it's fun to
keep it kind of innocent and I think it
gives us both an experience or a chance
to marinate
the date and kind of leave us wanting
more I guess that's it shouted Persian
babe and buting the blog one for
creating this tag I had so much fun
filming it because can I bought like
