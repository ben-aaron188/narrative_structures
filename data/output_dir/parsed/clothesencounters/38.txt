(upbeat music)
-  We're gonna
make sure you have a safe
and comfortable flight.
- Hi, everybody!
I've made it to New York in one piece.
It is currently 9:00 p.m.
and your girl is starving.
I am actually here because
I partnered with Innisfree.
I am doing a meetup at
their grand opening store
in New York.
I only brought one suitcase
which is a big feat for me
because normally like
no matter where I go,
no matter how long I'm staying,
I always take two bags.
I'm just such an overpacker.
But this trip it just didn't feel right
to have like two big suitcases.
So yeah, I minimized.
I'm actually going to
head on out to dinner
so I'm gonna put some
makeup on, get freshened up.
I also forgot to pack fake eyelashes
so I'm gonna go to the
corner store and grab them.
I'm here with Vanan.
If you guys don't know who she is.
I don't think I've actually
ever like introduced you guys
to her, but Vanan is the junior manager
at the management company
that I am with, Rare Global.
So yeah, I speak to her every single day
and so this is like our
first trip out together
so it's been really nice to
like hang out and catch up.
I gotta get ready because I've got...
Wow, it's already 9:19.
Wow, time is flying by right now, guys.
-  Only
bringing what I could carry
in my backpack.
Once again, I felt the lightness
of having so few things...
(calm music)
- Hello!
I am back from dinner.
Vanan and I had food at the NOMO.
It's just like right across
the street from here.
And it was just really nice
and I really, really enjoyed
having the little one on one
with her.
I don't know, I feel like
whenever you have settings
with a lot of people,
it's just easy for things
to just be very surface level,
so I'm just really happy
that I got to have some
one on one time with her.
I also got a couple of
things that I needed
from the drugstore.
First up, I got this top
coat from Sally Hansen.
I think I'm gonna repaint my nails.
I actually got them done at the airport.
They had this really quick
20 minute gel system.
But I'm just not digging
like this translucent look.
And luckily I packed in one
of my Oribe nail polishes
that I wanted to try.
So I'm just gonna paint that
and then put this layer over it.
I grabbed a pack of Simple wipes.
Fake eyelashes.
First, I've got these ones by Ardell,
these are just the Demi Wispies.
I also saw this brand, it's called Eylure
and I saw Nikki Phillippi
so I was like holy crap,
I gotta support.
So I got these ones which
are the wispier ones,
more spaced out, so I
thought these would just be
a really nice, like natural fluttery lash
for, you know, the future.
And then I had to get these.
I cannot escape the chips.
I'm probably gonna eat these
in like 15 minutes or so.
I'm gonna just take my makeup off,
watch some hotel TV, and munch on these.
Alright, so now I'm just
gonna take off all my makeup
because I hate having my makeup on,
especially when I'm just lounging.
So I'm gonna remove all that.
Now that I have bangs, I have
to have this little headband
because it just, you know,
tucks everything away.
Think I might go shopping tomorrow.
There's like a Reformation
right over there,
the Top Shop, opening ceremony.
So (gasps) I've got like
the shopping itch right now.
So I just cleansed my face
and I'm just gonna try
out this Innisfree mask.
They sent me a ton of
masks so I'm really excited
to try this out.
This is the It's Real Squeeze Mask.
Whenever I travel, I love
to put on sheet masks
because my skin can get
a little temperamental
after the plane, so I
want to really make sure
that it's in tip top shape for tomorrow.
Oh, this one's nice, it
just sticks right on.
There's a lot of face masks that I use
where it's like so thick that
it just refuses to stay on.
So you leave this on for 10 to 20 minutes.
Nice.
(groans)
My knee.
Good night.
(calm music)
Just ordered the avocado toast
and also I got a cappuccino
but clearly I don't get
cappuccinos very often
because I had no idea there
would be so much milk.
I think I mistook this for Americano.
Whoopsie daisy.
Good morning!
You guys, lighting is so nice.
I'm blessed because this
room has these huge windows
and it makes it just perfect for filming.
So I just cleansed my face,
there's nothing on it,
and now I'm gonna apply
this serum from Innisfree.
It's their intensive hydrating
serum with green tea seed.
So this is the first
product I'm gonna apply
after cleansing.
Kind of like wash off, tea on.
This formula really helps
reduce your skin's tightness
after you wash and it just
really adds a great balance
of moisture back into your skin.
And I believe it's a blend of green tea
and green tea seed oil.
So now that my serum is on, I'm
going to put some sunscreen.
Even though it's cloudy,
there's still UV rays out there.
This sunscreen also feels very serum-like.
Smells kind of citrusy as well.
I genuinely forgot how good milk tasted
because I only drink my coffee black.
But today I decided to be adventurous
and order a cappuccino, thinking
that it was an Americano.
And then I took a sip
and I was like holy crap,
this is just frothy milk
with a splash of coffee.
I'm just gonna go straight
into concealer now.
I'm using this one from Colourpop.
It is their no filter concealer.
I think it's so funny how I came here
right as Fashion Week ended.
I've actually been really
enjoying watching Fashion Week
just on social media.
I had zero FOMO and I
think I'm finally at an age
where I don't really get
affected by FOMO anymore.
I'm just genuinely happy for
the people that got to go
and I like watching the shows on my phone
in the comfort of my own bed.
It's just nice.
The last Fashion Week I went
to was last year in February
and, guys, winter in New
York is so miserable.
Especially for an LA girl.
It's really hard for me
to dress for the weather
because it's just so painfully cold.
I remember last time, me and
Ben, we were trying to go
to this restaurant that
was only like a block away
from our hotel and it was a
struggle getting out there.
The wind just felt like shards on our face
and I wanted to just have like a ski mask
and just a bunch of puffers on me.
And the last thing I was
thinking about was, like,
is my outfit cute?
Because it was just way too cold.
Now that this is done,
I'm gonna set everything with a powder.
I'm using Laura Mercier
translucent powder.
Turns out my friend Danny is
also gonna be in New York,
or is also in New York
right now, she just landed.
If I had known she was
gonna be in New York,
then I would have extended
my trip a little bit.
My flight is at 10:34.
It's like a 24 hour trip pretty much.
But if I had known she was gonna be here,
I would have like at
least stayed the night.
So if you guys don't know who Danny is,
she's the one who lives in Toronto
and she's the one who creative directed
my Eggie editorial lookbook.
She's a Scorpio, so we
just get along so well.
I don't fully really care
about horoscopes that much
but I don't know, why
is it that I get along
with every Scorpio that I meet?
Maybe because my moon sign is a Scorpio.
Now I'm gonna go in with brows.
I've been using this stay
all day waterproof brow color
from Stila.
So what I do is I'll only use
it for the meat of my brows.
This is just a really great product
that does a nice gradient.
Now that's done, I'll go in
with Benefit's Goof Proof brow pencil
and then I'll just start
drawing the rest of my brows.
Okay.
I don't really fuss over
them too much these days
because now that I have
bangs, it just covers them.
But I still like to draw them in
because you never know if
like the wind's gonna blow
or something.
I wanna make sure that
something's still there.
It's time for eye shadow.
I'm using this palette from Colourpop,
it is their I Think I Love You.
So I think I'm gonna go in
with this rose gold color.
Yeah, I'm not sure what
Danny and I are gonna do.
I think we're just gonna catch up.
I just kinda want to go
shopping for an outfit
because of course
everything that I packed,
I suddenly don't want to wear anymore.
I'm reading this book called Wild.
It's about this girl who goes
on this backpacking adventure
on the Pacific Crest Trail
and she only packed the things
that she genuinely needs,
like fleece socks, a
whistle, water purifier.
I would love to do
something like that one day
because, you know, I really
enjoy being around nature
and I like hiking and stuff
but I've never actually
done anything intense
like that before.
Okay, so now I'm getting
Level Up, let's do this.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay, so I'm gonna go
back into Rule Breaker.
And then getting a dense
brush, I'm gonna pop that
kind of like here in the
inner corner of the eye.
So now using this flat brush,
I'm gonna go in with that brown shade
and I'm just gonna smoke it out.
So I'm pretty happy with the eye shadow.
I think it's really gonna come together
when I apply these falsies.
But right now, I'm gonna
do a little cat eye
using Kat Von D's tattoo liner.
Can't believe it's already my
birthday month, it's insane.
Virgo season!
I actually rented a cabin in Big Bear.
I'm not the type of person
who waits for someone
to surprise me or plan
something out for me.
I am, I'm like very much a Virgo.
I just like to get shit done
and if I want something to happen,
I'm gonna do everything in my power
to make sure that it does.
I got this huge cabin in Big
Bear and it's gonna be so nice
to have all my friends there
and it's gonna be just
like a big sleepover!
There's gonna be games,
there's gonna be food,
and there's like a hot
tub in the living room,
so I think that's gonna be really fun.
Okay, so I just applied
Lancome's cils booster
and while that's drying, gonna contour.
This is Tarte's Pro Glow palette.
I'm gonna go in with Sculpt.
I'm just gonna chisel away.
Since I'm born on the 22nd,
I'm a Virgo-Libra cusp
and I really identify with both signs.
I know a lot of people just
like to like brush zodiacs off
but I feel like they're fun to read
because you're just more aware
of all the different
personality traits out there.
So Virgos are really meticulous
and they love structure,
they love scheduling, and I feel like
that's where I get my organization side.
And Libras, they're very social creatures.
They love making sure that
everyone's taken care of
and I definitely identify with that.
Ben is also a Libra and
he's just like Libra to a T.
For blush, I'm using this one by Tarte.
I've already hit pan.
Just gonna pop that apples in my cheeks.
And then for highlighter,
I'm using Strobe.
Around the nose.
For lashes, I'm using
Urban Decay's Trouble Maker
and I'm gonna use this for the bottoms
and a little bit on the tops.
I'm not like a die hard zodiac fan
and it's not like
everything's set into stone.
And I truly do feel like
whatever sign you are,
there's something that you can relate to.
So whether I was a Leo or
a Taurus or a Sagittarius,
there's all something
that we can relate to
and that's the beauty of it.
Alright, lashes are on.
I guess we're done.
I'm gonna do my lipstick...
Oh, I guess I should do my lipstick now.
I've just applied the lip color
and it's just kind of like
my lips but better shade.
It's like kind of like a glamorous look.
I enjoy it.
Just gotta work on my bangs
and then we'll be off to go see Danny!
And also Kristen.
Everyone's telling me to do
like Korean see through bangs
but I feel like I have
too much bang to do that.
Or I guess, I feel like this is
like the Korean see through bangs.
It's like a couple of strands and then...
I feel like I look so weird, okay?
I would rather just have
a full bang, you know?
Before I forgot, I had
to do a little room tour
of the hotel.
I'm staying at the 11 Howard.
So over here is the hallway,
you enter right over there.
Check out this beautiful room.
Little workstation.
The most comfortable
bed in the entire world.
View of New York from here.
Over here, you've got the bathroom.
So beautiful.
Oh my god.
You guys, it is so hot.
(calm music)
Three Musketeers!
A little reunion.
We had like a little
frantic shopping session
at Reformation.
- But isn't it always frantic?
I feel like whatever, you're
like I got this, that, that.
But yo, you look--
- I know.
Got all Reformationed out.
(calm music)
You guys, the entire wall
is made out of real plants.
They put in an irrigation
system to water it as well.
The future.
Alright, guys, here I am
at the Innisfree store
in Union Square and the
meetup is about to begin!
(calm music)
