hey everyone AC girl Jen and today's
video is about the top 10 products of
2016 I actually found one of these
videos last year but I thought I would
continue with the tradition because it's
just nice to have all my favorites in
one spot these are my ride-or-die
products and before I got started I
wanted to announce that I am going to be
uploading a video every Sunday from now
on I finally committed on a date
I chose Sunday because a lot of you guys
are home men and it will give me enough
time to prepare a video so my plan is to
try and upload two videos a week for
sure one will be on Sunday and the
second video will be sprinkled somewhere
throughout the week so that's my 2017
resolution to you and so now that I've
announced that let's get started with
the video I want to talk about skincare
items first so here I have Kate
Somerville's a gentle daily wash this
has been my go-to a face wash since
beginning of summer I've said it in one
of my favorites before and I've been
using it since then this is actually the
second step of my skincare routine so
the first step I'll use a cleansing mom
or a simple life to remove the first
layer of makeup off and then I will go
in with this cleanser to remove
everything else this is a really nice
soothing gel cleanser and the best part
about it is definitely the packaging I
know that's kind of like not that
important but to me I appreciate details
like this so what you do is you twist
the cap and then the product comes out
and then interest it back and then there
you have it I will be talking more about
how I use this in my upcoming skincare
routine video so just hang on to that
another skincare products that I've been
loving to use in 2016 has been SK choose
radical new age power cream and to
clarify yes I am still using SK choose
facial treatment essays for the day and
the night but I just added this heavy
duty cream because I am getting to my
late 20s
oh so it's definitely time to shell out
on stuff like this for me at least my
skin is definitely a priority to me and
I don't mind shelling out the big bucks
for this cream I apply this cream in the
evenings and this is the last part of my
skincare routine this cream is what
feels everything in
using STP products for two or three
years and my skin is been holding up
very nicely that's why I thought this
night cream would pair nicely to what I
use right now and like I said I
definitely would be touching more on
this in my upcoming skincare video next
step I have a primer this is from Tarte
and it's called the clean slate
timeless smoothing primer and I actually
got this recommendation from Claire so
thanks babe
now that I'm getting older I'm starting
to notice some fine lines especially
around my mouth these are my smile lines
and I've just been noticing that my
foundation sometimes does like a big
dent so this is where this primer comes
in I'll use this I'll really fill in
that area and I'll smooth it out so that
way my foundation sits on it as opposed
to going inside a wrinkle if you're
looking for a mattifying primer just
definitely isn't for you because it
still allows like your oils to come
through but this is definitely best for
if you're looking to like smooth out any
ridges or fine lines or pores then
that's when this primer is going to be
good for you
2016 was the year where I dropped a lot
of my foundation brushes and just simply
use the Beauty Blender I love this guy
this has been out for so many years now
but 2016 was the year that the Beauty
Blender and I really really bonded I
just love the way my foundation looks
like lye this and for foundation I've
been using Smashbox to do skin and this
one my Laura Mercier they're both my
favorite and just it applies so
wonderfully with the Beauty Blender it
looks airbrushed it looks flawless and I
just love how hygienic this is as well
because sometimes with my foundation
brushes I just didn't wash them every
time I should have watched them a little
bit more but with the Beauty Blender I
wash it every single time I mean it's a
little dirty right now but I'll wash it
before I use it because it needs to be
damp anyway so yeah shout out to Beauty
Blender I love you okay so moving on to
some more makeup products I'm going to
be talking about some eyeshadows that
I've been loving and 2016 was the year
that I just fell in love with color pop
eyeshadows and it definitely to do with
my color pop collaboration since
genocide claws came out I had to learn
how to use these eyeshadows because
they're definitely a little bit more
tricky to use because they're cream but
once you just get the right brushes and
you learn how to
use them if all I go to now because
there's no fallout you're super
pigmented and I just love the way it
looks so I know colour-pop has a ton of
different colors on the website but I
decided to narrow it down to my top
three favorites so my first one is
called a maze and this color is just
like the name it's amazing it's this
ultra glimmery rose gold shade and I
love to pop this in the inner corners of
my eyes I've already hit pan on this and
I just wanted to get a new one for my
second eyeshadow I have thirsty girl
this is a very very glittery brown Flash
gold
so I guess bronze color and this is a
beautiful everyday smoky eye brown shade
and I just love to use it on my lids I'm
wearing it right now and I think it just
goes well with any occasion and then for
my blending shade I have Toth this is
actually really similar to do which is
part of my janessa class collection but
since that was limited edition I wanted
to shout out something that was
available and this is a really great go
to blending shade it just goes perfectly
with my skin tone and I thought I would
shout it out oh yeah these are my go-to
shade in 2016 there are only five bucks
a pop which makes it even better my
go-to blush last year was Marc Jacobs
flesh and fantasy and I know the name
sounds super extra but it's just a
gorgeous color nonetheless this is a
dusty rose shade that I believe would
look beautiful on any complexion it just
adds perfect flush on your cheek I also
like the fact that this isn't too
pigmented there are some blushes where
you just hit a little bit with your
brush and it just gets on your cheek
like crazy
this is nice and buildable a doll have
to worry about overdoing it ever also
I've been using this pretty much
everyday it looks like I haven't even
made a dent on this so there's
definitely a lot of product on here and
the packaging is to die for it looks so
expensive luxurious and I just get
excited to use it every time I think it
takes you say that a lot of people in
2016 loved having a glow and I was no
exception and that's why I'm mentioning
tatras luminous dewy skin with this was
my favorite setting spray on making my
face look even bluer than usual most the
times I would only wear this on nights
out or if I wanted my face to look like
speak to the gods if you're looking for
a super glue
plasticky Sheen I highly recommend this
mist I use the setting spray on super
glamorous occasions because this is just
the cherry on top of a full face for my
lipstick favorite I have smashbox
outloud and I discovered this towards
the end of 2015 but I thought I would
mention it because this color just takes
the cake this is a beautiful Burt's be
Ana color and this is one of those
shapes that I feel like would look
beautiful on everybody I just love the
formula of this it's they're always on
liquid lipstick lines I love this
formula because it's not too matte it
leaves your lips feeling like hydrated
and not shriveled at all and also the
longevity is very very impressive even
though this is a bold color I don't have
to worry about the way it's fading on my
lips because it hangs tight all in all
beautiful color and I wanted to squeeze
it in just top 10 video initially I was
going to put in a mascara favorite in
this video but I thought I would just
skip the middleman and just go directly
to the falsies that I've been loving
either by blinking beauty and my
favorite salads were number four number
six but unfortunately I ran out of
number four and I only have number six
some special these guys to you I just
really love the way these opened up your
eyes and I just love the beautiful
flutter it has for me these lashes are
an everyday lash I amost Lee wore these
when it was a special occasion or if I
was filming something for you guys okay
so my last favorite is going to be a
fragrance this is Beach walk by Maison
Martin Margiela and this was also one of
my favorites before but I'm not kidding
when I love something I love it and this
was a birthday gift for my friend Emily
and it's just been on my body since then
this has replaced my other signature
scent which was C by Chloe but since
that scent just like stated away so fast
I decided to just move on and go on to
something better in my opinion this is a
nice bright light scent it smells
exactly like the way it sounds Beachwalk
it's very like bright inviting and I
just melt like fresh I just like to love
the way it smells mmm alright everyone
