hi guys my name is Jen I'm back in
NorCal and today was the first day of
winter quarter and I just got back from
class right now I'm filming this right
now before the Sun sets I was asked by
row new bandits to I went to a lookbook
for them a photo shoot so I thought I
would just film the outfits with Becca
well because I was already wearing
outfits and I thought it would make this
quick video for you and I have a quick
announcement for those who live in
Southern California I'm having a
meet-and-greet
on January 19th I'll put the flyer above
my face this is my first meet and greet
so I'm really excited to meet all of you
guys it's a limited space so please RSVP
I'll put the link down below and you can
see the more details on the flyer if you
stay tuned at the end of the video
we're doing a giveaway this first look
is quite dark and vampy but I guess I
was channeling my inner Morticia Addams
and I love this dress because of the
long leg slit and so you can flash a bit
of skin as you're walking and whenever I
wear a maxi dress I love to wear some
sky-high platforms I got these
after I saw sunbeams dress on YouTube
wear them and I had to get them they
look so cute
and I finished off the look with a brick
red lip from Mac
this next outfit just screams uber
comfort I think this is definitely
something I would rock to school I think
an anorak just instantly makes things
look super comfy and casual
hence I'd titled that outfit this and
underneath I'm wearing this speckled
rayon black sweater and as spikes all
around the shoulder that add just a edgy
tone to the look and for pants I just
went for a classic and neutral black
denim to streamline really seamlessly to
my black creepers and my creepers have
been doing me so well this year
definitely a 2012 fave of line and for
my lipstick I'm just wearing this pink
shade
I've been really warming up to the whole
sporty letterman jacket trend and I
thought I would do my own take on it I
was in one sport in high school I was in
track for a semester and I dropped out
because it was way too much for me so I
guess this is the sportiest as I'm gonna
get I paired it with my cropped
turtleneck from American Apparel and I
chose to wear my blue denim skinnies and
on my feet I'm wearing my new Dean
juries the style is called the Mitzi and
I love love the wooden wedge it's just
it's just a really interesting texture
and on my lips are wearing the same pink
lip from the previous outfit I
completely forgot how warm winter in LA
is and I was there when I was filming
this so if this offends you where you
actually have a winter I'm very sorry
I'm quite aware of it but if you're
living in LA I hope you enjoy or if you
live anywhere with a warmer winter I
hope you enjoy this outfit I'm wearing
this black Fleur skirt to kind of
highlight the busyness on top and I just
went for a very neutral heel
