- Hey everyone it's your girl Jenn
and here I am in the
beautiful lovely Phuket.
I am here through through Evolve.
And I had a couple of
extra hours to get ready
so I brought the camera down
and filmed a Get Ready With Me.
I'm gonna show you how
I did this really fresh
glowy natural look that is
perfect for humid weather.
I know it is winter in most places,
but in case you are traveling
or you live in South East Asia
or any environment
where it's hot and humid
I thought that this look would be perfect
and without further ado let's get started.
Hello everybody here is my bare face.
Since it is quite sunny out here
I'm gonna start with sunscreen first.
This is by Murad, it is
their Anti-Aging Moisturizer.
It's got SPF 30.
And normally this is Ben's sunscreen,
but we thought we would
consolidate, just bring one.
No need to bring so many sunscreens.
I can't forget my neck,
I always forget my neck.
Alright so now that the sunscreen is on
I'm gonna move on to foundation.
I'm using this one by Nars
and I've been seeing
this all over YouTube.
Everyone is raving about
it, including myself.
This has been incredible.
I put maybe like a pump or
two on the back of my hand
and I'm just going to dot it.
I've been using this foundation all week
and it's been great
because it is high coverage
but it doesn't cake up.
This foundation blends so well.
I'm in the color Punjab and
it is a great color match,
but we've been doing
so many different types
of activities here all day
and this foundation hasn't
been an issue at all.
Okay so that looks blended to perfection.
I'm just gonna skip concealer
because I feel like the foundation's
doing a pretty great job already.
Also whenever I'm traveling
to like a humid country
or climate I just want to
reduce the amount of product
I put on my face because
whenever I do like a full beat
in humidity it just doesn't
translate very well for me
so I'm just gonna move
straight into powder.
This is my favorite
one from Laura Mercier.
I have a cute travel
sized one, it is adorable.
So a few of you guys noticed
that I am no longer Close Encounters
on my YouTube channel anymore.
It just says Jenn Im now.
I just thought it was time for a change.
I changed it last week and I just thought
it would be smart for me to
just streamline everything
because whenever you guys come up to me
like 99% of you guys says I'm Jenn Im
as opposed to Close Encounters.
I feel like only the OG subscribers
call me Close Encounters anymore
and I feel like if you're OG
then you would understand
why I changed it.
Like also with the amount
of saturation in the space
I just wanted to make my channel
as easy to find as possible
and since the rest of my
social media accounts,
they're all I'm Jenn Im, I thought thatA
it would just make sense
to call my channel Jenn Im,
but luckily my URL is
still Close Encounters
so that will always be a part of me.
So now I'm gonna use this
mattifying powder by Catrice
and this is kind of
like a insurance for me
because I know I'm gonna get oily
so I'm just gonna hit this on my key zone
which is where I get the oiliest.
And I've already tested
this for flash photography.
It has no flash back, thank god.
So now let's move on to the brows.
I'm using Benefit's
Goof Proof Brow Pencil.
And I'm just gonna start
drawing in my brows.
Since it's the new year it is the time
for new year's resolutions
and I am no exception.
If you know me I am such a freak
for self improvement and self growth
and so for my goals for 2018
I would say I just want to focus
on improving my mental health.
So I want to continue working out
maybe three to four times a week.
I want to continue going to therapy.
I want to meditate at
least four times a week.
Before I was really gung ho
about meditating every single day
but then I started to notice
if I was struggling to
find time to meditate
I would kind of stress myself out
which kind of defeats the purpose.
So I'm gonna have, I'm just gonna try
and meditate as often as I can.
Maybe a goal would be four times a week,
but if I miss a day I'm not gonna
you know beat myself over it
because it is not supposed
to make you feel that way.
I also want to try my best
to eat as healthy as I can.
So I'm trying, or I'm gonna try my best
to have more of a plant based diet,
but I'm never going to fully announce it
because I think it's gonna
be like a slow transition.
I'm gonna start cutting out red meat
and then eventually white
meat and then all meat.
Just know that I will be trying my best.
Luckily in Thailand it's been quite easy
to eat plant based meals here,
or at least with no meat
because the way they cook
their food is so incredible.
The spices and the way
they saute their veggies.
It just really makes you forget meat
and also a lot of the
girls here are vegetarians
so it's quite inspiring.
So I'm gonna try and take the
habits that I'm getting here
from food and bring that back to LA.
So the brows are done and I'm gonna move
straight into the eyes.
I'm using Colourpop's Birthday Girl
and this is like an ultra
shimmery champagne shade
and I'm gonna just pop
that all over my lids.
I love the way this looks on the eyes
because it kind of makes your eyes
look a little wet if you know what I mean?
I think that really
works with this weather.
Oh yeah.
I wish you guys could just
see how glittery this is.
And of course if you've never
used Colourpop eyeshadow
I highly recommend you use your finger
because you just get the
most color payoff that way.
For the blending shade I'm gonna go in
with this eyeshadow palette by Too Faced.
I'm gonna use Fur Baby
which is just like your standard brown
and I'm gonna use that for
the outer corners of my eye.
For my channel goals I want
to try and figure out a way
to just kind of amp up my page.
I want to make more fun content
like my party for one look book.
If you guys haven't seen that video
please go check it out.
I'll put it in the cards.
Me and the LR creative
team worked so hard on it
and I feel like fashion videos
just don't do as well as they used to
or maybe there needs to be like a new
like format for them because
I feel like with YouTube
it's a little scary to try out new stuff
because if it's too different
people don't like it,
but if it's not different enough
than you don't feel excited
about that if that makes sense.
But I don't know, I'm
gonna try and continue
to figure out how to make fashion videos
more interesting and more clickable.
But yeah I would love to
know what kind of videos
you would like to see.
If you guys can be as specific as possible
that would be amazing.
Do you guys want to
see more beauty videos,
do you want to see more vlogs?
Yeah just let me know in
the comments down below.
Now I'm gonna use I Rough
You as my inner corner
and brow bowl highlight.
So now that the eyes are done
I'm just gonna give my lashes
a little squeeze with my lash curler.
And then I'll be ready to be primed
by the lovely Lancome Cils Booster.
I am so loyal to this guy.
I'm kind of running really low.
I'm gonna have to make Sephora order soon.
I packed so many false lashes on this trip
but I haven't worn them at all
because I just haven't
been in the mood really.
I feel like because it's so hot
I just don't want anything else on my face
that is extra so I've just been working
with my natural lashes and they're fine.
So while I wait for my lashes to dry
I'm gonna go in with this blush by Nars.
It is called Intensely
and it looks intimidating
in the package but I swear when it's on
I think it looks quite natural.
I feel like orange really
compliments my skin tone
and I feel like it's gonna really work
with this look that we've got here.
So I just applied this blush
onto the apples of my cheeks
and I feel like it
gives like a really soft
innocent flush of color.
You can skip highlighter,
but I am definitely not.
I'm using this Tarte Pro Glow palette.
I'm gonna go in with strobe
and I'm going to dust this
onto the tops of my cheeks
and then my nose and then
of course the cupid's bow.
And as the day goes on this
is just gonna look dewier
and dewier and it's gonna
look very fresh faced.
So the lashes are dry so I'm gonna go in
with this mascara by Lancome.
This is their Definicils.
A lot of you guys are asking about
how the wedding planning is going
and girls it is going, it is fun,
but it's also very stressful as well.
I think after our wedding I'll do
kind of like a video on
where we got everything
so it can give you guys
a good reference point
on where to get started.
We already got the venue of course.
We got the cake, the
flowers, the videographer,
the photographer, the linens, the tables.
And yeah it's been a lot.
I feel like wedding planning is all about
tiny little decisions.
It's kind of like when
you go to the optometrist
and they have that machine
and they go A or B, B or C
and they all kind of look similar
but you know you have to
make the correct decision.
So it's kind of like that.
And as for my wedding dress
I'm getting it custom designed by Mika.
We had a meeting earlier in December
and that was just kind of like, you know,
a get to know you meeting.
I showed him my Pinterest board
and so we're gonna collaborate together
and create the perfect wedding dress.
I am so excited for that.
We're gonna meet again after
I come back from Thailand
and so then he'll have some sketches.
And obviously I will be showing
you guys the whole process.
I think I'm gonna do like a wedding series
of how we created our dress.
So stay tuned for that.
So I'm gonna finish off
the look with a lip.
I'm using this one by
Hourglass, it is called Leader.
And it's just like a really
fun vibrant magenta shade.
I'm obsessed with this color.
I love the way it looks
with a minimal eye.
So now we're gonna seal--
(dramatic music)
Oh my god, oh god.
So now we're gonna seal in
everything with a setting spray.
I'm using Too Faced
Hangover three in one spray
and I really wish I brought my
Urban Decay Anti-Slick spray,
but I forgot it so this will have to do.
Mmm, mmm.
Oh it feels so good.
I just want it all over my body.
Alright guys this is the finished face.
I have been pretty much rocking this look
my entire time in Thailand
and I feel like it really suits
this beautiful environment.
I have been having the
time of my life here.
It's been so incredible seeing the sights,
eating the delicious food.
It's gonna be hard for me
and Ben to leave honestly,
but we've been vlogging
our entire time here.
Obviously gonna upload it to the channel
so stay tuned for that vlog.
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching
and I'll see you guys the next one.
Bye.
