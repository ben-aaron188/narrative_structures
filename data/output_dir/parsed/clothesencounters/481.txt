hey guys my name is Jen and I'm in a
stairwell right now but it's here I'm
doing spring fashion trends so I picked
out six of my favorite spring trends and
I'm gonna sell them for you on my lips
I'm wearing wet and wilds five two two a
which is the stark berry color and this
is after I've blotted it on a napkin
maybe three or four times and ASOS is
having a sale so I decided to take
advantage of it and so I picked up this
turbaned and it just keeps my hairs in
place especially on those windy days and
this is one of my favorite picks from
Goodwill and I just chopped in half
because I wasn't feeling the length
because it's way too long and what
attracted me to it was the little dots
on the side this please I thought it was
just kind of quirky and fun and I don't
know just I really like polka dots so
why not have it have a 3d version of it
on mine it okay first trend that I'm
loving which is can suede I love this
skirt because it has a really cute aline
silhouette which just really cinches
your waist and gives you a really
feminine shape and I love the fact that
there's buttons in the front so that
means you clasp in and out from there
and I think chance weed is just just
gives a really cool Western feel which
is perfect for the spring and because my
outfit was a little bit neutral I
decided to just gravitate towards my
tardies because they just add the
perfect splash of color and personality
to my outfit
as many of you guys know pastel is one
hot spring trend right now so I just put
it in blazer form and you can button it
together so y'all have like more of a
polished feel or if you don't like that
look just unbutton it and just wear it
casually and I love this blazer because
it has the black
lapel detailing on the top and I just
wanted to add a little bit more funk to
my outfit so I paired it with my pink
floyd tee that I got at the Rose Bowl
flea market and for bottoms I decided to
keep the edginess in my outfit so I
paired it with my studded denim and
these studs are firm stuff those spikes
in there the English 77 cones and I also
paired it with my tights because they
add a little bit of warmth you know my
bill that cold that spring day and I
just kept it really neutral with these
plain black suede pumps from Marshalls
so I went to H&M this weekend in Union
Square and they were having a sale on
these knit turbans and there are only
three dollars so if you like them go
because there were plenty of them when I
went you might think that this shredded
knit is not very springy Sh because it's
black but I think the opposite because
of the shreds it just makes it look
really lightweight and just really
spring ish in my opinion and if you're
wondering where you wear underneath it
you can either wear a nude bra a black
camisole or a nude camisole or a black
bra let just anything you want to show
off and for accessories I wore a
cool-toned angular necklace that just
adds a little bit of funk to my outfit
and this print really reminded me of
Jeremy Scott because it's yellow it's
loud it's loud print and I know I just
really liked it I thought it was a total
steal like goodwill and it doesn't help
that has the pleats on it I'm in love
with them and for shoes I wore my Jason
grades just follow along with the cool
tone pattern of my necklace
these scarves are the easiest thing you
can get at your store they're around 50
cents to maybe $3 the most expensive and
they just had a really cool pop of
accessory to your outfit and this is a
cobalt cutout dress and I really really
love the cutouts and I am a big sucker
for pleats so when I saw that this was
one of my favorite colors as the cutouts
and the pleats I thought it was just the
perfect dress for the springtime and I
know it's gonna translate really well
for the summertime as well and for a bag
I paired it with this pleather hobo bag
from case tell me and I think it just
really looks really expensive in a way
and I love the fact that and all your
things are gonna get lost in it because
you can put your most valuable things in
this little mini pocket container that
I'm showing you right now put your
cellphone some gum your glasses or
sunglasses just anything that you really
need and it also has an adjustable strap
so you can take that off if you just
want the black straps or if you want the
whole thing you just keep it on just all
really depends on you and for shoes I
paired it with these mary-jane pumps to
add I don't know just keep with a girly
theme of this look
although it's spring it's still a little
bit temperamental outside so it's really
important to invest in a lightweight
jacket and I love this jacket because of
the houndstooth pattern it has leather
elbow details come on it's perforated
and there's also leather lining on the
edge it's just the details that make it
look really expensive and cute and you
can also button it all the way up to
just have it as a top just a plain top
but for this outfit I paired it with a
graphic tee because I really like
pairing kind of grungy edgy looking
pieces with something really polished
and clean super bottoms I decided to go
with my putter skirt to kind of play
along with the lining of the jacket and
because I wanted more color just added
my tardies if you couldn't tell already
I kind of went crazy on ASOS they were
having a bunch of crazy things on sale
including this dress I love the color
it's totally on trend and look at those
pleats man this is just an insane shot
of the pleats I'm a big fan of them and
I think they're perfect for this any
season literally and for my bottoms I
wore some dot socks from drunk 21 and I
then i pair it with some really neutral
classic pumps if you guys have any
