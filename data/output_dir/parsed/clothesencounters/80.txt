oh hi everyone it's your girl again and
in this video I've partnered with lorac
Los Angeles to show you this soft spring
look I'm using the new limited edition
part of the Caribbean collection that I
revealed last week on my Instagram and I
wanted to create a look inspired by the
film so let's get started with the
tutorial I'm beginning with my base and
brows already done just to speed up the
process so I'm going to zoom straight
into the eyes for eyeshadow I'm using
lorac limited edition Partha Caribbean
palette which is inspired by captain
Jack Sparrow's compass there's a
whomping 18 eyes shadows in this Pro
formula palette and they're all unique
because lorac never repeats any shades
so I'll be dipping into pirates chest
which is a matte tan shade and I'm going
to throw this right on the outer crease
this is going to be a beautiful blending
shade to start everything off on the
right foot then I'm using lorac from the
line eye pencil and bronze which is a
gorgeous shimmering metallic and I'm
going to start filling in my actual lid
with this color next I'm using C haze
which is a nice seafoam flush olive
color and I'm going to apply that right
where we put the bronze pencil it just
acts as a nice base so that the colors
come out more saturated then going into
argh which is a shimmery dark brown I'm
going to use this as a transition color
from where I applied the blending shade
and a seafoam color it's just going to
tie everything together now I'm using
menace which is a deep forest green like
almost a block shade and I'm going to
apply it out right on my bottom lash to
intensify and give it more of a smoky
look then using the front of the line
pencil in black I'm going to start
lining the top lash like this and then
I'm going to grab an angled brush and
start flicking it out for a soft cat eye
shape I didn't want something to define
so I've opted for this method to make my
eyes pop even more I'm going to use
shiver me which is a shimmery white
highlight shade I'm going to Pat that
right into the inner corners of both
eyes and then right on the brow bone I
want to give this look a little bit more
green so I'm going to apply C haze all
over the bottom eye just to give it more
fade then I'm going to use lash pomade
mascara and I'm going to do a very
generous coat to my bottom lashes and
then pop them on the top but not that
much because I'm totally going to throw
on some falsies
there because I always want that extra
flutter moving on to the face we've got
a contour I'm grabbing the pro contour
palette and I'm using the light shade
and I'm gonna start making those
cheekbones really come through now I'm
grabbing the Pirates of the Caribbean
cheek palette and this packaging is
inspired by Corinna Smith's diary in the
movie and it's so cute it looks like a
little notebook I love that you can
store it inside the pull out panel on
the side of the eyeshadow palette inside
there are six shades some shimmery some
matte and I'm going to use Caribbean and
dust that onto the apples of my cheeks
for highlight I'm using star reader and
dusting that onto the highest points of
my cheeks nose bridge and the Cupid's
bow of course for the lips I'll be
choosing from the six shades from the
limited edition collection which are
inspired by a trident in the film these
are so cool because on the end there's a
lipstick and on the other is a gloss
these cream lip doors are designed with
complimentary rather than matching
shades so you can decide to wear them
together or each on their own and this
is the finished look it's perfect for
the season if you want something soft
and smoldering
