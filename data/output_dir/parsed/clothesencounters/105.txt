I am freshly showered this morning I
just pounded out the work I uploaded my
holiday gift guide so if you want to
watch that feel free to click on the
little I that's the card feature on
YouTube and then you'll see the video
there Ben and I went to the orthopedic
doctor and they did some x-rays and then
they put like an actual cast on him the
doctor said that we're gonna wait a week
see how it's healing and then do some
more x-rays to see if he needs a CT scan
and then from there we're gonna see if
you need surgery but right now
everything is just up in the air but the
doctor didn't seem too worried so that
makes me feel better about the whole
entire thing she said this is a really
common break that happens to a lot of
snowboarders so let's just hope Ben has
a quick and swift recovery dog saving
mochi right now and it's good because it
keeps chickie running around so yeah I'm
just gonna finish up my treatment for my
November favorites and then work on my
goodwill video I guess Paco chooses Oh

his right hand so he can't even press
like the button so we're gonna get
creative we're gonna set up some tripods
and see how everything pans out yeah

a rush today because I'm about to head
on over to the revolve social house to
do a live makeup tutorial

on and I'm going to be using all the
beauty products they saw on the website

list and so I'm going to do my eyeshadow
they're my contour highlighter all the
rest of my makeup when I'm there so
that's why I'm all dolled up right now
I'm like really out of breath because I
feel like I've just been running around
the house doing things live always makes
me a little you know nervous but I'm
just gonna pretend like I'm on Facebook
live or something and just kind of be in
that mindset all right so let's go
pretty much my little stage in here and
this is gonna project onto it these
dreams this cow

so much fun doing the revolve live maker
