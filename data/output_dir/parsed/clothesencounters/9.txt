- Hey everybody!
It's your girl Jenn and welcome back.
Today I have a very large
thrift haul for you.
Because in my previous
video, where I get ready,
I asked you guys what types
of videos you like to see
and a ton of y'all were like,
"Bring back the thrifting videos!"
So, I went to my Goodwill
Outlet Center and it was
actually my first time at the outlet.
And an outlet and a normal
Goodwill store is different
because when you go to the outlet,
there are no price tags on anything.
Everything just comes in a
big blue bin and you just
kinda have to fend for yourself
and at the end when you
checkout they just weigh
everything and roughly every item
comes out to like a dollar or two dollars.
But if you get like a heavy
jacket maybe it'll be like
five bucks but regardless you get a deal.
But it's definitely intense.
I wanna show you guys
all the goodies I got,
so let me know you my loot.
First up, I want to talk about this white
sweater I purchased, this
is by Zara Man and I love
that it's oversized and super comfy.
It's kind of got like
an athletic feel to it
because of the two thick
black stripes in the arms
and it just sits really
comfortably on the body.
I was debating whether I
wanted to crop it or not
but I decided against it
because I like the length.
It hits mid-thigh and it
looks so cute with some
thigh high socks and a beanie.
All in all this a really
casual comfortable piece
to add to my wardrobe.
Coming up next, I've got
this lovely red jacket.
This is very boxy and cropped
and I love the silhouette.
It's got kind of like a denim jacket but
instead of denim its in
like a wool material.
I absolutely love the color red and I love
pairing it with outfits that I think are
too plain or need a little extra oomph.
See here we have a very
large striped polo.
This is definitely
something my dad might wear.
Maybe that's why I like it.
It's got kind of like
a familiar feel to it
and it's also something that
I feel like Unif might carry.
This print is very like teenage skater boy
from the 90s and I love it.
I would rock it with the
buttons all the way up
and untucked with some trousers.
I feel like it would give off
some cool androgynous vibes.
Moving on to something
more feminine and flowy,
here I have this floral blouse that is
definitely channeling OG Sarah vibes.
I feel like she would have thrifted
a shirt like this and I love this print.
It's got pops of red, it's got polka dots,
and it's a little gody but I love it.
I noticed that a couple of
the buttons were missing
and so I decided to knot it
and I feel like it really
just elevates the whole look
and makes it more modern.
So I've got another flowy item.
This is a beautiful black
floral dress and I'm just gonna
call this my dinner date dress
because it's sleek and sexy.
And definitely something
I would rock on a night
that I wanna be more dolled up.
I love maxi dresses that have an
asymmetrical hemline
because generally I just
think its more flattering on petite girls.
That way you're not
drowning in the fabric.
I also love the subtle white floral
embroidery on the bottom of the hem.
I feel like if I wore it with
like a white baby doll tshirt,
it would work really really well.
My next item is this sick wind breaker.
I love the pattern because it
reminds me of an oil slick.
It's got all the colors in one,
like the moss green, the
purple, the burnt sienna,
and I just think it looks very retro.
It's kind of in the silhouette
of a member's only jacket,
but this is a lot more light weight.
In fact, this a really great
like summer night jacket
because you can just kind
of scrunch it up like this
and just stuff it in your purse.
And when it gets cold at
night you can unravel it
and be warm, and look stylin'.
So I'm pretty sure that
this next item is from
the children's section.
This a tiny graphic tee for
a soccer league and the shirt
fits like a baby doll tee
and I think it's so cute.
It's in that thick material cotton turns
when it's been washed so many times.
I love the tiny graphic on the side and
the large statement image on the back.
And I'm just a sucker for athletic wear
even though I wasn't very sporty as a kid.
I was in track for like a
year, but that's about it.
So yeah, I'll spend the
rest of my adulthood
collecting little athletic tees like this.
So I've got a couple
of bottoms at the store
and the first pair I wanna talk about
are these black chino pants.
These are also children's/tween clothes.
Yeah it says the size 10 in husky.
They remind me of Dickies,
but I like how they're cropped
and I just generally think
that these are a better fit.
These are great for me when I want
to take a break from jeans.
This next item, I'm
super stoked on because
I found American Apparel denim pants.
These fit pretty similar
to me as the disco pant,
but these actually work better on me
because they're more cropped.
They fit right at the
ankle and I just love this.
This is just really exciting
for me because I remember
when American Apparel was poppin'.
I used to wake up super early
for their warehouse sales
and wait in line with all my friends.
Just to get like defective
American Apparel clothing.
I am very happy that I now found
the jeans for a dollar now,
so we've come a long way.
So this next item I scooped
up for Ben actually,
in hopes that he'd like it.
I love this type of tartan.
It's very like true to
the lumberjack style.
It's thick, I just think
it looks really worn in.
It looks very vintage but it's actually
from Abercrombie & Fitch.
I think this is a really
great layering device.
I feel like flannel will
never go out of style
and so that's why I wanted
to add this to my collection.
So the last item I have
is this floral robe.
It's in a very clean, cream color.
It's got this vibrant,
yellow floral embroidery
on the lapels and the sleeves and
overall looks very very regal.
I know that this is going to
be an amazing beach cover up
or just a shawl to put
over summer dresses.
It used to have shoulder pads
but I just snipped them off
to make it look more modern.
Alright everyone that
concludes my one dollar haul.
