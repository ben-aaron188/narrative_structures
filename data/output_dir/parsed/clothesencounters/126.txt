driving through this beautiful row of
palm trees hello guys it has been a
while but here I am at the goodwill
outlet center in Glassell Park I have
been wanting to do a thrift video for a
very long time
honestly I've just been procrastinating
but today is not that day you have to be
sneaky as well because uh you're not
supposed to film I've got the camera in
my hand yeah I'm gonna have to kind of
discreet yeah I always get kicked out
when I film at thrift stores they just
don't like the list it all scares them
yeah you're scary-looking no it's good
well the cafe I'm very excited about oh
I need a coffee
alright guys we just finished a
successful trip to Goodwill I was a
little rusty when I first went in it was
very very overwhelming over so much
stuff it just stresses me out I can't do
this like rocks and rocks and rocks a
star thousands yeah I've gotten got in
the groove got some good stuff and we
didn't get chucked out so now I'm having
dinner at this talking free
with Dawn who is my graphic designer she
is far ordering our food Donna said what
I feel like my life has changed so much
since I met her
dinner tonight because she can't be
there for my birthday somehow
okay it has been an hour and a half but
I have finished my fall makeup look this
is it it is a very glamorous vampy one
for the fall I kind of wish I had
somewhere fancy to go because this is a
look
I feel so glamorous right now but then
and I don't have any plans on going out
tonight so but it's just Shane just wash
it all off so I'm just going to try and
wear this as long as I can and also yes
I am wearing colored contacts these are
in like a nice brown hazel color they're
from Gemini contacts and they sent me
these and then also yellow and gray ones
I haven't even opened those ones out of
the package yet because I'm just playing
around with these ones for now and I
have crazy astigmatism and they were
able to make a contact just for my
prescription so I'm so thankful so Thank
You Gemini contacts so I'm back now I
took off all my makeup because it has
been confirmed that we are not leaving
the house today
I believe Ben and I are just gonna be a
cooking fish tacos we're using Chrissy
Teigan recipe I have a book called
cravings and we've actually never used
any of these recipes so we thought we'd
change that so today we're making her
skillet charred fish tacos we don't have
a skillet but we do have a pan so it'll
be pan seared fish tacos I'm pretty
excited I'm waiting for Ben to come home
and then we're gonna start cooking
dinner while I'm waiting for him I think
I'm just gonna be editing ghent mber
number three so I was just minding my
own business
editing working and then I get a knock
on the door and look what comes in holy
I have 12 cupcakes from sprinkles the
team at color pops I'm into me because
this generous o´clock collection is
officially over it was a good Club but
all good things come to an end and now
I'm going to celebrate by getting fat
and eating one of these look Molly aid
is tacos hmm yay here's all our
ingredients for taco night
hey guys it is Sunday I am at the
montage hotel here in Beverly Hills it
is so nice here
they have little avocado toast on
gluten-free bread hors d'oeuvres it's
pretty fancy I am here for the woman
making history brunch one of the
sponsors is Pandora jewelry so they
invited me here so I'm so so excited to
be here currently just waiting on Ashley
is definitely to get here and then I'm a
whole crew here
whatever Tea Room she doesn't see me yet
but
and back advocacy about to watch rice
cake which is one of my favourite films
my West everything on my sounds itself
there's the back of their heads there's
the front of their heads and are here
I'm fall off a cliff
I am currently having a pretty
productive day I uploaded gent ember
episode number 3 it's out now I am
working on a rough cut for the fall
bombshell makeup look this is a video
that I'm doing with Smashbox and for
those who don't know what a rough cut is
it's kind of like the second step of
like the sponsored video route so the
first step is to make a creative
treatment and a creative treatment is
basically a page of what exactly is
happening on your videos so it's like
your video but in essay forms if you
write everything out and then once that
gets approved then you have a rough cut
date and a rough cut is basically you
making the video like the basic skeleton
of the video and you don't really need
to put in music or like fancy text or
transitions or anything but for my
experience I've learned that it's just
best to just go ham on the rough cut
because if you don't put like the bells
and whistles then the brand is probably
gonna come back with like you know
comments saying like we want this we
want that so it's just best to just put
your best in the rough cut so the brand
could see your full vision and then once
the rough cut is approved then you make
a final cut with all the revisions that
you guys agreed upon and once the final
cut is approved that is uploaded on to
the YouTube channel so that's pretty
much how sports videos work in this
video I'm pretty proud of because I feel
like I've never done a makeup look like
this before and I think it's very at um
know if you will
I am officially out of the house it
feels good I am running errands right
now I'm going to two showrooms I'm going
to bury gold and then bill RA and I'm
actually really excited to go to these
showrooms because I have a couple of
fall videos in mind for you guys so it's
going to be amazing to get to pick out
some stuff that I think would look good
I hope for the look book out there both
in Hollywood so I must make the trek out
so it is 4:18 and I realized I forgot to
eat lunch this is very very rare I
always remember to hold my meals as I've
said food is very important to me so
right now I'm eating chicken vegetable
soup with kimchi and before you judge me
I swear it is so delicious if you like
spicy pickled things I mean why not add
it to everything hmm I'm exporting my
rough cut right now because I worked
yesterday I am NOT stressed out at all
today
everything's on time everything's in
order this is the feeling that I'm
always chasing after feeling productive
feeling happy and just being on schedule
I met one group my favorite Korean
Saphir and we're getting this home
dinner and the kimchi nuts g-tube
I have officially contracted the virus
going on in LA it's not good I was
getting sick earlier last week and I
thought I fought it off but nope it is
evolved I have a runny nose now it was
pretty bad last night too but oh
that's the medics coming for me bye
Emily's boyfriend is a doctor and so I
asked her what he thought about working
out with this virus going on and she
told me that I should work out that is
what the doctor advised that and I
should just wipe down the equipment when
I'm done so I don't spread the virus so
that's why I'm in my workout clothes I'm
about to head to the gym even though
that's the last thing I want to do I
just really don't want to be sick for my
birthday it's coming up in two days and
it would be awful if I was sick at the
roller rink hey guys back from gym you
know what time it is
hey you changed the dressing this is not
the sesame dressing that they normally
give so this morning I've just been
working on my thrifting video by the
time you watch this it should already be
out so please kick kick please click
here to watch tomorrow is my birthday I
am so excited and also a little anxious
I feel like everyone gets some weird
birthday nerves when it's like your big
day I just realized I never told you
what I was gonna do for my birthday so I
have rented out the roller rink
it's called moonlight roller way
something like that and so all my
friends are gonna be there it's gonna be
greaser themed so all the dudes are
gonna wear their moto jacket all the
girls are gonna wear that off the
shoulder
satin bombers or vice versa it doesn't
really matter I just love a good theme
and my girl Emily is actually the one
that thought of this idea with roller
rink and the Greece theme and so thank
God for that cuz I don't know what I
would have done if she hadn't mentioned
that to me just look how beautiful this
lunch is this is my favorite scallops
cucumber crab and I believe that is tuna
look I'm driving Jenny's driver
passenger see I've got a lot of driving
today Anna
usually when you offer I still don't let
you but let you just i interested gets
you drove to three very mysterious
places as you know it's Jens birthday
tomorrow and when you're with each other
every day it's very hard to kind of
arrange stuff and you know I'm just
popping out what you don't is popping
out for about four hours so yeah that's
been difficult my mom's cooking
everything today so I'm really excited
obviously that's gonna be qgj which is
my favorite and then we're gonna have me

that soup for your birthday I do not
