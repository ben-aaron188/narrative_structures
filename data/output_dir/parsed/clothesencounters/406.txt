hi guys I'm John it's the end of the
month so that means we're doing a
collective February haul I've wrapped a
number of things this month so I thought
I would show you guys so we're gonna
start off with the American Apparel
because these are my most proudest
purchases and things I've been really
really waiting on we'll begin with the
Navy disco pants pretty sure you've seen
me often my black lines I think the
reason why I went for the disco pants is
because of the shape it gives you these
are literally like a corset they just
suck your belly in and just flatten
everything out and just maintains your
booty too and plus I love the lustrous
and luminous fabric of the disco pants
because it just makes it the perfect
item for evening wear next is a circle
skirt I've been wanting this for a very
very long time super durable and I know
it's got the shape that I want which is
that beautiful flared out a line shape
and plus it's this really like starched
out denim material so it really really
keeps its form and structure I am
planning on wearing it with some chunky
lightweight sweaters and pairing it with
a skirt because it's just going to
really make this sweaters transition
well for the warmer months
moving on to jock Vanek she's one of my
favorite brands it's really
tongue-in-cheek and kind of edgy I just
love things with a twist like this shirt
on first glance it looks like something
really sweet and feminine but if you
look closely it's quite funny and kind
of vulgar instead of really sweet
messages they have really crude you know
sayings like nope loser in rural life
eat dirt I think my favorite one is
probably suck it I got one thing from
Nasty Gal
it's this off-the-shoulder striped crop
top so it's three things I love and I
personally think that all the shoulder
trend is actually timeless it's been in
fashion since the Victorian era and I
think it's just really coming back in
style full blast this summer plus it's
one of my favorite parts of the human
body boys and girls and I think it's
just fun to flaunt it next we have
plunder they let me pick out a few more
items from
there's shop and I'm gonna show them to
you guys we have this crop top from
Bella brawl and I love this shirt
because it's it's cropped and it's got a
really foxy fit so it's just really
loose and airy and perfect for the
spring of summer I think a graphic tee
is an essential basic tab in your closet
because you can wear it with pretty much
everything like fuzzy sweaters or if you
want with a leather jacket a Cardian is
just a really versatile piece next I
have this skirt it is just a really in
your face in the Gen 2 color and I think
this would be perfect to wear with the
neutrals in my closet or if I'm going to
a pattern it's gonna be in a very demure
shade once the weather warms up I'm
definitely going to wear my black mesh
crop top and I think mesh is kind of
like laces evil cousin but it's really
hard core and for a top that's revealing
I'll either wear a nude bra or I'll wear
just an all-black
block lace panda over it next I am
holding these cream denim shorts there
by mink pink and this is gonna be the
perfect spring bottom because they're
white and they just ooze summer because
of that net trimming all around the end
and they kind of have a loose paper bag
fit like I should have got an extra
small but it's nothing that a belt can't
fix
here's another spring /summer piece it
is this crochet long sleeve top it's
could almost be worn as a dress because
it's pretty long you can just wear
something like a nude or tan skirt
underneath it and bam you've got a cream
lace dress I would say I'm pretty
liberal with my fashion as long as you
feel comfortable in it I just don't see
a problem with it as long as you feel
comfortable and amazing in it whose
place is it to tell you that you can't
wear that that's just bizarre in my
opinion next up I have this multi
colored fabric but the colors are quite
you know subdued and muted and it's got
a really cabin woodsy outdoor feel
because of this pattern and it's just
overall just really cozy kind a little
throw over on little spring ensembles I
just love the little kind of toggle
buttons because it just kind of
emphasizes that hey this is
our where I have these mary-jane
platforms which are pretty much the love
child of my peep toe marriage or Jayne
pumps from daily look and my Marshall
suede pump the ankle strap of this mix
actually functional to walk in because
as much as I love my Marshall suede pump
because it doesn't have any support from
ankle they're one of my most difficult
shoes to walk in but this has that shape
but it has the little strap on it so I
can pretty much rock these wherever and
I'm super excited
next shoes are these wedge heel
platforms I don't even have to call them
but they kind of look like a cog don't
they the heel is what really drew me to
it because they're really similar to my
freitas and I'm obsessed with the way
that looks and plus it's got a little
ankle strap and it has a zipper opening
so you can just kind of slip in and out
of them and I personally love the way a
really thick fat clunky shoe looks I I
don't know I don't know why I just I'm
just drawn to it the next pieces are
from motel and if I had to pick a little
block dress it would be this one because
it's just very simple and it's off the
shoulder and it's got my favorite cut
which is the a lion you're really able
to showcase and highlight a really crazy
necklace or if you put your hair up you
can show off your earrings I think that
this just really hugs the right places
on your body because it it's really
fitted on your bust and the small of
your waist and it just kind of jettisons
out into this beautiful flattering Flair
next up I have a romper or a playsuit as
some people call it and it is this grid
pattern but it is hombre which is kind
of a twist and I like that I think for
the spring I'm probably gonna wear it
with kind of heavy outerwear like a
denim jacket to kind of just toughen it
up and give it a little bit more shape
because sometimes a romper can look a
little bit childish but I think with
layers if you can really make it look
like you're age and something that is
for a woman and not a small child
moving on to akhirah I just got this
mustard beanie if you don't know me I am
a fanatic for beanies I'm kind of
delusional about it because I will wear
a beanie whatever the temperature is
outside
if it's cold and windy I'll wear a
beanie I'll definitely wear beanie but
if it's hot I'll wear B but I'll just
wear some shorts with it I love this
beanie because it has little distress
holes all over it so it's kind of a
beanie with an edge lastly I have some
pieces from gypsy warrior I have this
really neat on galaxy print cutout dress
I absolutely love the back because it's
kind of course that stuff because it's
such a summer piece
I love contrasting it with just black
like a black moto jacket or something or
if that's a little bit too crazy for you
I would wear just a black lace cardigan
to kind of just you know cover up the
arms and add a little punch of darkness
to it and my last piece is this
acid-washed denim button-down I think
I've explained my affinity France has
lost thousands of times but in case you
don't know my name is Jen and I am
addicted to acid wash you can just
either wear an outerwear like a light
cardigan and it just adds the perfect
amount of coverage to your arms and
warmth for the kind of breezy days or
even just wear it as an actual shirt but
I like to tie it in a little 90s not so
it's kind of cropped at 12th the sleeves
and you just have this really cute you
know
cropped button-down and plus it's acid
wash so it makes it ten times greater
that's none of my haul please check the
