hi everyone its Jon I hope you guys had
an amazing Christmas so a couple of
months ago me and my friend Marty agreed
to do a Christmas gift swap and for
those who don't know who Marcia is her
youtube name is cutie pie Alexia and she
is an Italian babe who's living in the
UK and she does videos on fashion beauty
she does DIY videos she does even like
scary spooky ones her Channel pretty
much covers a lot of things so I'll put
her YouTube links down in the
description box so check it out so
basically the package arrived a couple
of days ago and these are the contents
that were inside even the cart she gave
me was just absolutely adorable it has
this roll on it and it says gangsta rap
on the bottom and look at its eyes
they're so cute and far apart so the
first item is this Yellow Submarine tea
defuser
I love tea and beetle so it's kind of
like a double whammy and you essentially
just pop it open from the side and you
place your leaves there and let it chill
I think it's going to be great for my
single serving tea sessions she also
gave me a bag of chips and if you've
been watching my channel for a while now
you know that I don't have much of a
sweet tooth I'm definitely more of a
savory girl I love me a big bag chain of
chips especially if they're spicy and
this one's got a little bit of chili oil
to it it's wintertime and my hands are
always pretty dry and so I'm really
happy that she's sent me in this hand
cream this one is by Crabtree and Evelyn
and it's a very moisturizing formula
next up are these drink stones you just
pop them in your freezer and you put
them in your drink to keep them cold
but without diluting it and it's gonna
be awesome to use when I have my friends
over for a party perhaps a whiskey
tasting maybe she's not me another
winter essential she gave me this body
butter and it smells like cocoa and it's
just got such a rich fragrance to it and
I'm really excited to use this after my
next bath and smell like a giant
chocolate bar this next item is not a
piece of chocolate it's actually a
bronzer just shaped into a really
classic chocolate bar I haven't had a
chance to put it on but looking at it
from the package it looks like something
that would
just my shade she sent me a lip set from
Lourdes and very this first thing is a
lip liner and it is in the color
invisible I don't have a lip liner for
every one of my lipsticks so I'm really
glad to have something that's going to
be so adaptable to any of my lipstick
shades from the same grin she also got
me a nourishing lip balm I love the
packaging because I've never had a lip
balm disguised as lipstick there's
something so glamorous about applying
something in the shape of a lipstick
tube I absolutely love silver jewelry
and your girl Marcia hooked me up with a
fistful of silver rings they came in all
different shapes and sizes and so
they're going to be really awesome to
just layer up my fingers and just work
them all at once as much as I love
fitted things I also love oversized
pieces she got me this tie dye shirt
with a graphic print of a skull and I
think it's gonna be perfect to wear
either half tucked in with a great pair
of jeans or to wear at bedtime as a PJ
shirt she also sent me this incredible
black tulle dress it makes me feel like
a princess from the dark side motele is
on my favorite brands too so I'm stoked
to own another item from them I plug
crystals so this next piece really hit
home because it is this beautiful quartz
piece and in the middle there is a slot
where you put a little tiny tea light
candle in and I think it's such a
gorgeous piece that's gonna go so well
with the theme of my house
thank you she actually sent me a book
that I have been dying to read it's
called 1984 and it's been on my to read
list for a very long time the only thing
I knew about this was that it's supposed
to be like a futuristic book and shit's
bad and that's all I know about it I'm
not gonna spoil it by reading the back
or anything so I just want to go in with
a clear and fresh mind she got me this
really awesome bonsai tree planter set
and so I can basically plan my own
bonsai tree and I've never planted a
tree or a tree let alone a plant in my
life and so I'm really excited to start
one out and see if I have a green thumb
I'm good at maintaining plants but I've
never grown a plant from its birth so I
guess we'll see how that comes out stop
is a beautiful white
no book that has white lies embossed on
the front it's also got some gold
ribbing on the pages and it just looks
like a prop from a Sofia Coppola movie
this last gift just kind of blew me out
of the water I like kind of choked
Damone's fit when I saw it she got me a
Fuji Polaroid camera and I've wanted to
own a Polaroid camera for so frickin
long and this is the first picture I
shot with it it's of Mila Kat Kingsley
and she just looks like photogenic in it
because he's kind of a chubby cat but in
this photo he looks very like you know
chiseled and he has those cheekbones
and so I am so excited to take more
pictures with this and just kind of
capture my life in a different way with
the package she included a roll of film
and a cute little photo album container
and so I can kind of display my pictures
in a really beautiful and organized way
I am just completely stunned and floored
by Marcia's generosity and her
thoughtfulness this is one of the best
Christmas gifts I've ever had in my life
so thank you so much I I really
appreciate it and this was one of the
best Christmases I've ever had if you'd
like to see what I gifted her you can
