hey guys so a little sty update it's
doing pretty much the same I think it's
a little bit more red today I have this
urge just like massage it and hope that
it bursts but I'm pretty pretty sure
that's not what you're supposed to do at
all
so today Ben and I are going to target
to get some sheets for the mattress
inside my office that's where his
parents are gonna stay and then we're
gonna grab some new pillows a duvet so
pretty much just setting up that bed
room I feel like this is my shade I
think it's a little darker
Bend on the search for some socks got my
socks
next up bed supplies for mummy and daddy
yeah I want to always wanted to get
those euro pillows a euro pillow Wow
let's get two let's get two of these
they're only ten oh there's only one we
did it I found lots of pillows but two
of the euros yeah we did it we found sue
euros
everyone's gonna sleep very well
pillowcases we look I think it's a nice
beige pillow case for Ben's mum and dad
all right so we have transformed the
office into a second bedroom for Ben's
parents this is the nice duvet we got at
Target along with the pillows and
everything mrs. Ben's idea look how cute
little details like this are nice to
come home to a little reading chair read
and look out at the view I think we did
a pretty good job
we're probably the world's largest sugar
band harris-perry vitamin supplement
we put your bodyguards kwitny shut up
shake the limited-edition sisters today
is the day today great morning this is
coming off and I can shower again we can
scratch it scratch it
I've try not to get my hopes up just in
case I'm assuming you have to get an
x-ray yeah and I don't to get too
excited in the case to like actually you
need surgery and you got another six
months were so excited I feel like it's
my wrist I think I think you're more
excited than I I know
Wow
so how does it feel it feels weird
very good I have a skinnier version of
my own slender
it feels very weird the lady said to
move it and trying to stop the moment
I've moved my wrist in six weeks so I
need to wash that's all yeah definitely
it's gonna be so nice to run hot water
on it
so actually I have a funny story from
the doctor's appointment I don't think
she's ever gonna see this so I'm just
gonna let you guys know I scheduled this
checkup a couple of weeks ago and this
is my first time at my new hospital so I
went in just to see if everything's okay
I didn't realize that I was scheduled
for a pap smear so like okay this is
happening my doctor walks in and she
looks at me and then she looks at my
form and she asks me what I do for a
living and I told her I make youtube
videos and then she looks at me a little
harder and she's like I think I've seen
you like didn't you do something with
Blogilates or over 589 and I was like
bingo and this is minutes before she's
about to examine my cooch
now she knows everything about me
literally I also got some blood work
done if you guys haven't gotten checked
up maybe this will be a good reminder
for you for the girls especially make
sure you get a pap smear to see if
everything's okay there it's so hard
putting on makeup with no contacts on
because I'm literally so blind I would
have to be this close to the mirror in
order to see everything I've got a few
phone calls to do and then I believe
Emily and I are gonna have dinner
everyone's gonna come over to our place
afterwards to meet Ben's parents
right now they all went to the grocery
store to pick up the food for tonight
but I'm gonna go see Emily because I was
in her in two weeks and then she's
leaving again on the weekend so I'm just
making a point to have a one-on-one with
her so I've stolen Jen's camera and I'm
taking my mum and dad's shopping this is
my dad Jeff oh yeah
that's mom back there Sheena aka mommy
we're having some friends over tonight
they're gonna meet mum and dad so gonna
go get some snacks show mom and dad all
the naughty food that America has to
offer
first stop obviously the naughty cookies
that's going in you cannot go wrong with
it to Kootenai board Jen would kill me
if I forgot these wraps her favorite to
show mum and dad the English section
they have baked beans and the nicest
things in the world but they are 329 in
England met 50 payments Jen's heaven
right here so Jen told me not to get her
any Cheetos but whenever she says that I
kind of feel like it's a test because I
think she really does want me to get the
Cheetos so this future
you have to I got them
see I'm gonna hate myself in a couple
hours yeah we might fall later having
peeping pop with Emily my sty sister she
doesn't have any ties anymore
hi guys i am at Stephanie's how I are
creating signs for the woman's March
tomorrow very very excited it starts at
9:00 a.m. at Pershing Square and it's
very important that we do this so mm-hmm
so ROYGBIV
you know - yeah in order right now but
once you can make it yeah right orange
yellow I didn't go I just got you no no
honestly this looks like the entire
rainbow yeah yeah I mean we could create
the color some you want if they really
want yeah
morning it is the day of the March it is
country 921 so 20 minutes until the
autopsy
see
hey guys so it's the morning after the
March and I just wanted to check in and
kind of reflect on how I felt yesterday
being there in solidarity with 750,000
people in Los Angeles had me shook it
was also a first step for me to use my
platform for issues that I believe in
and also to be more politically active
in November I made a promise to myself
and to you guys that I would and I want
to thank everyone that's been so
supportive of my decision because it's
pretty scary to vocalize how you're
feeling in the political sphere because
people get very very offended people
write you off I've been getting some
comments a handful of comments saying
that I don't even have a right to March
because of my mistake in the last
election and I don't think that's fair
because everyone learns at different
times and at least I'm doing something
about it as opposed to continue feeling
apathetic about politics I'm I'm I'm
researching I am participating in events
that I believe in and I think that's a
huge step and I want to thank everyone
that has been super supportive and
understanding and also sticking up for
me
I really really appreciate that anyway I
am very excited to vote in the midterms
next year don't you think that I forgot
I sure as hell did it I just uploaded my
Q&A with Sarah it's going down really
well a lot of you og subbies and and you
subbies too are enjoying it which makes
me super happy I will leave the video in
a card on the side of the video so
please open that I think later on the
and Ben and I are going to be making
dinner I think it's gonna be shepherd's
pie something nice and English and
perfect for this weather
two cups is one pint
look at that mom
they finished fish pie hey guys it's
probably not the best angle but Ashley
and I just got back from a meeting and
we're just having lunch at this place
called all those doughnuts got a
sandwich oh my goodness I'm at Graham's
place guess what she's filming hoarders
for an entire year I brought her to the
garbage from my old place to here and
it's been over a year
why did I'm like this have to stop well
this is so much I'm just at Stephanie's
house just gonna get some work done and
I haven't seen this little one in like
five three days so three days time wow
it's been a minute three days okay so
while she films this I'm just going to
edit oh my gosh I just I just tossed
Stephanie that you can put the rice
cooker paddle over there look look how
perfect it goes there Wow I always do
this to the end just to put it on top
you're supposed to do that thing that
mean we're the guys like thank you
yeah so as you can see emojis over I am
dog sitting here while Ashley is out and
chicky has some good company I could
literally watch this for hours you guys
I'm wearing this big jacket because I
think it's been ingrained in my brain to
not turn on the heater I I don't know
it's just I don't know man it's just age
and parents you're never supposed to
turn on the air-conditioner and you're
never supposed to turn on the heater
just a deal with it by wearing more
layers of clothes I should probably turn
on the heater though because it is
pretty chilly so right now I am writing
the treatment for my January favorites
video I just feel like I'm on a roll
right now I think in December I I pre
recorded a lot of things maybe and now
I'm able to upload two videos a week so
I'm feeling pretty good I'd only have
much else to say to you guys there's no
huge updates this die is going away
slowly but surely it's minimizing I got
I don't know if I told you guys this but
when I went to the doctor they gave me
this antibiotic ointment that I put in
my eye
so that's been that but it's been
officially ten days since I haven't worn
my makeup and to be truthful this
lifestyle is really freeing like getting
ready it literally takes me five minutes
maybe six minutes because I just put
some concealer on powder bronzer blush
highlight okay when I say like that it
sounds like a lot of steps brows but
it's a lot quicker than I normally get
ready and I get I get I get ready pretty
quickly
our jury
Wow wait a minute this is really good
all right hey guys it is Saturday and
today is the big day my parents are
gonna meet Ben's parents for the very
first time and funny enough I'm not as
nervous as I was a couple weeks ago so
that's a good sign my dad made
reservations at this place called feed
dragon restaurant and it's a Korean
restaurant but it it makes Chinese food
so like jajangmyeon junk Bowl it's all
my favorite dishes so I'm pretty excited
about that honestly I don't know how
tonight is gonna go I'm sure it's gonna
be fine but now that I'm talking about
I'm like psyching myself out but I know
it's gonna be totally fine it's
something that everyone who is getting
married has to experience and I'm gonna
try and document as much as I can but if
it's too painfully awkward then I'm sure
you guys are gonna understand if I don't
film it right now Ben and his folks left
to buy some flowers they're getting
tulips because that's my mom's favorite
so they're gonna have a little gift for
them so I thought that was really
thoughtful and sweet also stye update it
is officially gone
thank the Lord it is gone and so today
I'm wearing some eye makeup and it's
crazy because this feels really heavy to
me now before this would be like my
natural going to the grocery store look
but today I feel like it's a lot of
makeup it was so funny because when I
uploaded the first episode of January
everyone's like so did the sky go where
nah like I didn't mean to leave it at a
cliffhanger I didn't know it was gonna
be so important but yeah it's officially
gone and thank you so much for carrying
and then what else is happening today oh
Steph's annual Lunar New Year party is
happening it's gonna be at her new place
or I guess she's been living there for
quite some time but she's gonna be on
her place and all her friends are gonna
go and it's gonna be awesome
so I'm very excited
that here we are at the dragon
restaurant

minutes early we wanted to make sure
we're very punctual the engagement

worlds colliding alright the dinner went
fantastic

her second annual Chinese flushed Lunar
New Year party look at these decorations

living room section over here we've got
a nice fan here some lanterns and over
here we've got a nice beautiful party
spread oh Temptation Island here I came
for you my god will get worse where's
the pepto section over here you know
what's that I'm probably the one who's
drinking like half of this bottle of
Idaho this is why I hate wearing fish
tags
our toes just all kind of lead out and
it's very uncomfortable
who okay happy Sunday everyone currently
in the car on my way to my parents house
I love these cat chips in the car it's
nice because I've got my own little
space last night that dinner couldn't
have gone better I am so grateful for
that
my dad just riding up store I'm talking
about his future plans to Europe and how
he's gonna visit London and it's really
sweet because his parents were like oh
you guys have a place to stay and I
don't know it's just I'm just so happy
that everyone got along and it couldn't
have gone better
but yeah I wanted to be home before like
2:30 because I wanted to wake up early
to upload the proposal video move oh my
gosh that response for the proposal
video has been insane and I want to
thank you guys so much for leaving all
your comments and oh my god I love when
you guys send me your ugly sobbing
photos on Twitter it made me feel good
that other people were crying too like
I'm not a pretty crier like when I cry
I'm like heaving sobbing so you guys got
to see that side of me a lot of you guys
saw when Ben and I first started dating
and two and a half years later now we're
engaged I think this is the last day I'm
gonna vlog actually because what today's
the 3830 is when I try and do a monthly
vlog in February - I like vlogging
everyday is tough the vlogging
sporadically and what I want you that is
totally doable it like really puts it
does really put any pressure on me so I
mean the system seems to be working but
the problem is I don't know what to name
the February vlog I want to thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next line love you guys
what are you happy to be with mommy and
daddy or your grandparents hmm
three days ago oh thank you
you
