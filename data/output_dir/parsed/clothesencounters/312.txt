hi everyone welcome to another episode
of favorites in which I will recap the
greatest things of last month I'm gonna
start with nail polish I have been
rocking Blues on my fingers and are my
toes all month long and I've been
totally loving it
I've been switching off between SES 5
you know ASIS and OCC's poolboy the SE
polish is this really nice minty milky
blue it's that type of color that
doesn't clash with anything poolboy on
the other hand is definitely more
in-your-face it's a brilliant and creamy
blue the formula polish is really dense
and opaque you can get away with
painting one coat but I just like to
paint two coats no matter what because
it's just a habit of mine unfortunately
I didn't see any notable films this
month but I did get stuck to do Chu
detective it is an amazing show like I
can't believe season 1 is over I feel
like there's this gaping hole in my
heart it's kind of like how I felt when
I finished house of cards
HBO can do no wrong the show is about to
detectives played by Matthew McConaughey
and Woody Harrelson and they are living
in like a really obscure part of
Louisiana it's pretty like rural and
there is a serial killer and it's pretty
scary and very mentally thrilling and
very dark my favorite character on the
show is obviously Matthew McConaughey's
character rust he is just so dry and
wise and nihilistic I feel like
everything he says I have to like listen
to twice to kind of re-evaluate it in my
head I've only seen him in that movie
How to Lose a Guy in 10 days and to see
him warp into a character like rust is
so impressive it just shows his range
and acting so I would say Matthew
McConaughey is my March favorite and my
man crush as you can see I am wearing
glasses because your girl got a nasty
ass I'm fection
from contact lenses it was getting
really bad so I went to the optometrist
they gave me some special medicated
eyedrops told me I couldn't wear contact
lenses until further notice my eyes were
in a lot of pain on Sunday and Monday
so I listened to Hunger Games on audible
and it was amazing to get sucked into
that world and out of this misery cuz I
couldn't see anything it really sucked I
know I'm super late on the Hunger Games
bandwagon but I'm on it and that's what
matters right I think I initially was
kind of I don't know I just didn't want
to try out because I thought it was a
book for like very very young adults but
no that is not the case at all this is a
book for everyone it gets really really
intense and I'm really excited to start
catching fire next if you would like the
experience of being read to just having
a voice tell you a story then you can
get a free audiobook at audible comm
slash close the link will also be in the
description box so check it out
if you've already read Hunger Games
you're not interested in that book that
I am sure you will find another
audiobook to choose from because
audibles library has literally hundreds
and thousands of options to choose from
so you're about to find a book that you
like one thing that I added to my
morning routine is chugging a very tall
glass of noni juice so I'll put the
concentrated amount inside the glass
maybe an ounce and then I'll fill the
rest of the cup with water and I'll just
chug it I'm just gonna be real and tell
you that it does not taste very good it
is
tangy and kind of sour and has like a
really musky aftertaste to it it's
really not that great but it is really
good for you it's supposed to have tons
of benefits like boosting your immune
system and it's packed with antioxidants
some noni juice advocates claim that it
can cure cancer and heart disease it's
not scientifically proven but I will
leave it up to you to do the research to
see if it's worth it for you to drink
noni or not I was lucky enough to see
crap work play at the Fox Theater in
Oakland I my mind was blown it was the
greatest show I've ever been to in my
entire life and I can safely say that
they're all just playing on stage the
visuals are 3d and super trippy if you
don't know who Kraftwerk is it's alright
I'm just going to lay it down to you
right now
they are the godfathers of electronic
music or more specifically robot rock I
think it's safe to say that they're one
of the world's most influential bands
like hundreds of artists have sampled
their stuff like Depeche Mode LCD
Soundsystem jay-z Afrika Bambaataa and
even Coldplay yeah the list goes on and
you can google it if you're curious to
know who have sampled their music
there's a little floaty thing lastly I
want to give a shout-out to my snazzy
key sunglasses these are called Vienna
and it's just got a really interesting
clear frame and has this awesome golden
yellow polarized lens I was rocking
these babies in Napa and it was so
freakin sunny and so they just kind of
protected my eyes from the UV s and
whatnot alright so that wraps up all my
favorites from March I would say that
this month has had a lot of ups and
downs lots of downs especially the eye
infection really was a buzzkill but did
your March suck if so let me know if it
didn't just let me know your March eyes
I would love treat about it I love you
all and I will see you in my next video
bye
