boyfriend Ben a lot of you guys are
curious about us and so we are answering
some of your Twitter questions today you
ready I think so
okay let's get started the first
question comes from Phoebe and she asks
how did you two meet we were recording
in San Francisco and our guitarist John
it was good friends with Steph soothing
sister one night he was trying to
convince me to come out on his likes you
know Steph's best friend's gorgeous come
out so he just showed me a photo here
that's alright she's great uh-huh
literally that was the start of it
this one's from Katrina where was your
first date
uh it was Alexandra pallor yeah thought
somebody I went to park near when I was
living in London and yeah we've got some
got a nice little picnic out some
sandwiches mhm yes very nice some
waitress little waitress so Claudia asks
do you have any cute / funny nicknames
for each other
this is well all the little crappiness
elf gods going we have so many games our
most popular ones are bump Andrew yeah
right they're interchangeable yeah
sometimes
well I'm mostly Bob and he's mostly rude
but sometimes we switch it up yeah I
think he's trip as well we have
something unique names that we got
randomly come up with nowhere yeah he
even got me these slippers for Christmas
that have bubble on them and they're
pink and there with like diamond
crystals on it this one is from Lauren
Ashley Helen loves I'm in a
long-distance relationship too when
you're together do you like to explore
go on adventures or lounge around more I
think when we first see each other we
want to like lounge about order at
Domino's or domination yeah what some
friends or modern families only really
easy and just just enjoy each other's
company and and then we like to explore
them yeah during the day we always tried
to make most of it um I mean we did a
really good job in LA so far like we've
hit up the Huntington Library gonna get
see the Getty don't know
Disneyland Disneyland we've done so much
yeah that's a good excuse because we you
know that when you don't really go do
touristy stuff in your home city or
wherever and with you it's a great
excuse and like we're very good we do a
lot we go to great restaurants and we
definitely live it up so uh but yeah we
enjoy our chill time as well that's very
important yeah it's a great balance of
the two mmm the next question comes from
Naboo Yamamoto what is your favorite
sweet that you both like or any food
that both of you could share honestly we
have really similar tastes in food which
is so awesome especially when we're
going to restaurants yeah we kind of
just swap we have a bit of a meal then
get you have something yeah I'm like
we'll just trade plates
Finnick the next question is from
Jessica have you guys gone to a concert
together if so what was it like we've
been to a number of concerts together
most recently it was Aaron style which
is awesome thanks Ana for the tickets
you're the best but our first concert
was Leeds and then ready yeah burning

in England its greats like our biggest
well other than Glastonbury is our
biggest one and we were playing at the
time it's the first time you can see us
play and we like playing like the main
station for us it was like a big deal so
I get some very cool so yeah come watch
us play we're awesome and actually did a
vlog yes ready you know so I'll just
leave it here if you want to watch it
Ben isn't it
spoiler alert so this one's from Roxanne
um is there a joke that's only you and
him can understand love from France the
one that we're just doing is um this
kind of theme song haha
that created we are both obsessed with
SimCity we play it on our iPads rigs
each other and you know just work on our
towns I hope you describe me you like
zoom in and out and just you zoom in and
turn around it's like you know when you
get a film when you go to skyscrapers
and you kind of really like epic
soundtrack so we do that and it seems to
make it off every time and sometimes
we're just walking around the city
so this was some little lion what is one
unique talent she/he has well then is an
amazing cook he cooks the best breakfast
is lunch is dinner as everything it's
just so crazy because sometimes I look
at my fridge is like there's like
nothing to make and then you'll just
whip up something absolutely amazing
you're just like put it in the oven or
pan fry something ah he's the best guy
you've got a lot I think my favorite
ones probably or your whistling
especially like your Christmas whistling
God yes but it's only Christmas songs
because the range is quite minimal thing
I think we're all waiting here ok ok ok
if I can't I can't with a little smile
just get it out - shots set buzz wait
give any requests Fergus um we wish you
a Merry Christmas yeah no this is from
Adriana what advice would you give
someone going through a long-distance
relationship right now does it get
easier or harder
I heart you I hold you I guess feeling
connected is the number one things you
always have to kind of text each other
or make time for FaceTime calls or sky
because you're kind of making up for for
like lost time yes opposed I think
photos are really important like even
like we take photos of every meal we're
having and just just making it feel like
it almost there and you know what we're
doing and like that's really important I
said feeling connected is so important
it is every now and again we'll have a
few days where we can only text or
something and that even that alone gets
quite hard but you're something just
hearing a voice and like we do a lot
voice memos and video messages things
like that also I think limbo is
something that's you know the long
distance relationship like not knowing
and you're going to see each other which
sometimes we have to deal with because
you know right we don't know when the
touring things like that so like acting
schedule yeah and I think like knowing
when we're going to see each other that
helps a line when you don't know that
can
difficult so definite vise would be have
something plan know when you're going to
see each other so Ari asks have you met
each other's family oh we actually met
your family a few days ago which was
great we went to your hometown and had
some great food Oh songyang so much food
it was great it was really really nice
to finally meet you folks and your
brother and yeah they're lovely people
when it's really nice to see how much
like that like you your mom so caring
and like your dad's a cheeky notice is
good I met Ben's family a couple of
times down I go met your parents first
time at ready yes yeah
ready vegetable so that was kind of you
know a lot going on and then we had a
nice Christmas roast right yeah that's
right yeah we went to the oldest pub in
England how still properly so guys do
both of you have different sense of
styles if you do do you usually argue
about each other's style I'm Adele
person we have to kind of plan what
we're gonna wear or let each other know
what we're gonna wear so we don't worry
the same thing yeah especially the moto
jacket
mm-hmm yeah there's been times we're
both getting ready we both walk out and
both got leather jackets on back please
Emily okay this one is from sequins love
how do you kiss when you have lipstick
on any tips for maintaining that color
there is a lip color by Makeup Forever
and it's part of their line where it
just like doesn't rub off and similar to
Maybelline's infallible it's just
basically once it dries it just stays on
but usually when I when I see Ben I'll
just do like a little lip gloss or just
like a slight with tint or something
this one's from the teeth hey Latif he
asks what exactly is a piece of piss
inquiring minds want to know
you take that well I told you that what
I'm gonna know you did that in one of
your videos yeah everyone was like what
there was a piece of cake
yes it's definitely definitely English I
know you you got off me um it's
basically just it's easy so you know
that's a piece of piss you know alright
it's definitely kind of lad talk so this
one's from Bell what's one thing you
love about each other that's it's very
much as cheesy as it sounds it's very
hard to pick one thing for
me I guess like you're so caring like
you you're so like you so you if I have
a cut you blade give me a band okay I
feel like not like what anyone would do
yeah you're very patient that's a huge
one you're just really giving and
patient and very considerate you're just
just really good personal all right
