girl Jen and welcome back I am here with
the very first episode of favorites of
2018 because January is officially over
I would love to know how this month went
for you because some of you guys are
telling me that it went excruciating ly
slow but for me it was literally just a
wash of the month so please tell me did
it go slow or fast let me know in the
comments down below either way I'm gonna
chat about some of my favorite things of
January so let's get started so I'm
gonna start things off with a fashion
favorite first here I have this
windbreaker from Kappa I posted this on
Instagram pretty recently when I was up
in the bay and a lot of y'all were
loving this including myself I wore it
the entire weekend when I was in San
Francisco and it truly was such a great
day tonight peace in the daytime when
the Sun was out the material is
lightweight enough so I'm not
overheating but when I would wear at
night the material it just cuts to the
strong winds so it's just very
multifunctional and it looks so cool
it's very retro and vibey I love this
jacket it is a fun teal color and teal
was actually my favorite color in high
school so I'll always have a soft spot
for this shade now I'm gonna move on to
some beauty favorites here I have Fenty
beauty's gloss balm and I know I am so
late on the Fendi train but I look at I
say I feel like I'm always two or three
steps behind the beauty trends but I
must say this is completely worth the
hype this is definitely on my top 5
favorite things at fanta beauty and I'm
not normally much of a gloss girl but
when I do find a gloss that I love I'm
very loyal to it I absolutely love the
shimmer and this is just a really
universal shade for everybody I think
this is flattering on any skin tone and
I love that it wears beautifully
throughout the day normally with some
lip glosses it just feels really sticky
and there's that weird film on your
mouth it doesn't happen with this guy
drop the day it just feels like you have
like a nice moisturizer in your lips and
I love that also it smells so good
it just smells like candy like
each candy this is bomb so recently my
favorite foundation to use has been this
one by NARS this is their natural
radiant long wear foundation and I am in
the shade Punjab I wore this in my get
ready with me in Phuket and this has
been on my face non-stop since then I
think it's because when I was in such a
humid climate it held up then so this is
just a trooper for me it likes to just
stick onto my face which I completely
love this is also very high coverage so
I only need maybe one or two pumps with
this guy one to just cover my entire
face and the other pump to just get
around my under eyes when I use this I
just skip concealer because I'll just
use this product and I really like when
I can use one product in many ways with
some foundations I find myself looking
kind of cakey but I love that this has
kind of like a velvet satiny finish it
just looks like your skin which I enjoy
for me and my skin this foundation is
definitely a fit for me
so my next item is a beauty tool I have
finally got my very first epilator and
I'm very proud because before I got this
I was plucking all my armpit hair this
is like a weird activity that I started
doing since my freshman year of high
school because I never like shaving my
armpits because I found that when I
shaved them my pits just look darker so
it just became a habit to pluck every
single one of them and it just became a
part of my routine until one day I told
Amy and she was like why don't you just
get an epilator and so she recommended
me this one and I bought it and honestly
this was worth every single penny it now
takes like less than a minute to take
off all individual hairs from my armpit
and it's been incredible this is the
device there are two settings there's
one and two two I never use because it's
just too fast I just find it very
painful but one is definitely doable I
would show you how to like actually use
it but my pits are actually pretty clean
right now I did it maybe three days ago
so they were in good shape feel free to
use this device anywhere that you grow
hair like your legs down there it's just
awesome because it is so quick speedy
and you stay hair free for a lot longer
in January I finally ditched my Canon
t3i
god bless her soul because she was the
first DSLR that I ever purchased this
was back in 2008 or 2009
so since like the birth of this channel
but that t3i just really documented some
great memories any time that I used
equipment that wasn't the t3i while I
was walking it just didn't compare to
the quality and just the standard that I
had for vlogging but I knew it was time
for a change because it was just getting
way too heavy like I was lugging around
an 8 pound piece of equipment everywhere
and I was hurting my back and I just
knew that like there is there's got to
be something on the market for me where
it is just a lot more efficient so I
asked my friend Jesse who knows a ton
about camera equipment and so he
recommended me this this is the Canon
EOS and 6 I also bought a wide-angle
lens to attach with it because when I'm
vlogging by myself I don't want the
frame to be too close and I like to just
have just everything in the screen and I
can choose to crop if I want to but yeah
I bought these two pieces separately and
this has been amazing to vlog with I've
logged my entire second half of January
with this so you guys will see the
footage later but it meets my standard
and it is so easy to just bust it out
and start filming with my Canon t3i I
would have to like manually focus and
set the exposure but with this it just
does everything for you it's kind of
like a pimped out version of the canon
g7x and this has truly been such a great
investment for me and I can't wait to
just start vlogging more this also has a
flip out screen so obviously perfect for
vloggers and I am just stoked about this
very happy to have graduated to this new
camera my last favorite is a TV show
called end of the effing world this is
on Netflix and this was recommended to
me by Silas who is so so span he just
texted me and Ben was like hey watch
this new show and we're like okay and we
loved it it is a black comedy featuring
two teenagers it's kind of like a Bonnie
and Clyde because they are just the true
definition of a ride-or-die and at first
when you watch the show you don't really
know what to think of the characters
like they're actually kind of unlikable
in the beginning but as you continue to
watch it they become very endearing
and they bring out the best in each
other or maybe the worst either way is a
really fun and easy watch I also love
the way it's shot it kinda reminds me of
West Anderson with like the cemetry and
the flat leis and just the quirky
characters I would highly recommend it
if you're looking for a new show to
watch
alright everyone that is a wrap on my
January favorites
I'm so sorry that I don't have a book
favorite for you I actually spent
January reading the 4-hour workweek and
I did not like it and if I'm gonna be
frank the author just kind of seemed to
kind of douche-baggy I really like
halfway through and I was like I just I
just can't finish this so yeah I didn't
want to recommend you guys a book that I
didn't like anyway I hope to find a
better book to read in January I'm
thinking about reading a Thousand
Splendid Suns a lot of you guys would
recommending to me that so I need to go
read it I'd spent a long time since I've
read a fiction book and I also love the
Kite Runner so I'm gonna go check that
out next month if you guys have any
fiction books that you'd like to
recommend me please read it in the
comments down below I will add it to my
to read list but yes as usual please
write down anything that inspired you or
something nice that happened to you last
month in the comments down below I would
love to read about it and thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next one bye
