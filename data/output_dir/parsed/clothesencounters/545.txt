showing you guys what's into both of our
purses also we're going to answer some
of your questions that you asked the
first that I carry around regularly and
I got this purse from Urban Outfitters
and got three years ago there's like a
kiss slump clutch in the middle so you
can put your really important things in
there I always carry around sunblock and
this is SPF 100 by Neutrogena don't
really like getting town so because my
skin is like super sensitive so I always
have to slaughter this all over my body
when it dries it's really matte so it's
cool to put all over your face - and I
always put this before I put any makeup
on a cannon just like a point-and-shoot
I have a DSLR but I just use this to
take like quick snapshots not only want
to look like a three-pound thing in my
purse wallet and it's hot pink when I
used to have a white one but I lost it
along with my license and everything
there's like a picture of like a cat on
it with like yellow blood I did this in
high school
super yellow inside I got at 4:21 it's
just kinda like your standard wallet and
a pack of gum and today I'm four bit and
it's wintermint my phone with me and
it's a palm pixi and right now it's dead
because I left my charger in seven

makes like cute little sounds for like
that a pressie sound just like that
sound is it that was carry this white
like contact case carrier and I got it
from this Japanese store called Meucci
where they don't believe in labels so
nothing has a label on it on my compact
and it's by Mac and it's pre old it's NC
25 on I'm a lipstick that means Sarah

cool like coral color and it's good for
everyday years and it's more neon in
real life

this lipstick in my purse at all times
it's this color called Rose pick the tab
it's a really creamy formula so when I
have this I don't need chapstick either

something I could
put up a couple of rings that I throw
into my bag that kind of goes everything
with gold one is silver ones so with a
bronze like kind of grand you're just a
little bit funky I black moleskin
planner that I got Barnes and Nobles I
love it a lot because it's just a really
basic solid color pack of post-its

really sad like I don't have a clock and
I don't have any communication with
anyone that I've done here already

of my own piña or maybe your closet
smells like a pro store high school I
actually dress really plain I work just
t-shirts and jeans because I was in a
really exclusive monogamous relationship
where we were practically married and
neither was care how the other person

like really expressed like my tastes and
stuff after we broke up

election wrote it in my personality just
kind of was amplified because I was my
own first I guess and it wasn't really

my look or anything it was just kind of
an happy
being on your own on the high school I
really just like super girl you like I
would put on like fake eyelashes every
single day for no reason
