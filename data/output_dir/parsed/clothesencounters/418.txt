to be more specific and it's gonna be on
January 19th and I would love to meet
you guys
it's vital that you guys RSVP because
it's a limited amount of space be sure
to look in the description bar for the
RSVP link as well as the flyer and just
more info you might want to read about
it's gonna be a really exciting night
because you can get your nails done
there you can come hang out with me you
can shop there because BB Dakota and red
cents you're gonna have a rack there you
can look at cool art you can just hang
out with you know just peers I'm getting
a little bit anxious because I don't
know what to wear these event type
things always kind of stress me out
because there's so much pressure to
dress you know in something very nice
this is where you guys can come help me
out I felt for looks and it would mean a
lot to me if you guys would comment down
below and let me know which outfit you
think I should wear for the event
welcome to option 1 and this is probably
my most casual and simple look I love
the look of distressed and torn up hobo
sweater and the sheer little number has
a bunch of holes in it that add to the
whole disintegrating look and these are
one of my favorite drifted vines these
were originally long bell-bottoms but I
just hacked them off and shorts rolled
up the cuffs and called it a day now
they just looked like a really modern
piece and I belted the shorts with
another goodwill item and for tights I
went along with these very sheer
stockings from a drugstore on my feet I
chose to wear a very classic suede black
heel and they call them at any outfit of
mine on my lips I splashed on a
beautiful sheer pink color and finished
off the look with these silver earrings
that kind of like waffles
option two is my very comfortable yet
stylized outfit it's got a lot of look
to it and it's this bizarre blend of
boho and grunge and love the bell-sleeve
on this top as well as the beautiful
scalloped edge and for my skirt I'm
wearing this faded blackish gray tartan
pattern and I'm really digging that like
slate such a fun and unexpected way to
flash some skin on my feet I'm wearing
my insanely dirty freitas please do not
judge me they're so gross but I did a
shoot with them on on this really muddy
Mountain landslide type of thing and I'm
gonna wash these after I do this
voiceover because it's bothering me
anyway I've been enough the look with a
little black beanie to make it super 90s
option three is a mix between the edgy
and the refined so let's start with edge
I'm wearing this black leather top
that's encrusted with these dainty and
subtle silver studs it's a new fresh
twist on the stud and over the top I
picked out this white blazer I went
ahead and cuffed up the sleeves to make
the blazer look more polished these
velvet pants from motel are the same
silhouette and fit as the disco pants
which automatically makes them a
favorite of mine and I find that it
really seamlessly transitions into my
black suede lace-up boots for
accessories I simply piled on my usual
bundle of turquoise and silver bracelets
and I finished off my look with an
orange lip
this is my last look and I think I'm
leaning towards this one but the
downside is that the microdot pattern of
the dress makes it look super tripped
out on film it's so weird but the dress
is perfect in real life because as the
cutouts and this turtleneck I just don't
know why it looks so funky on camera
it's killing me anyway I layered over
the dress with my trusty cropped moto
jacket I find that a moto works with any
type of base if you want a funky feel to
your look and let's shimmy down on over
to the feet and talk about one of my
most womanly shoes in my collection I
love the strap on the shoe because it
makes these sky-high platforms
very easy and functional to walk in
so thank you so much for watching
remember to comment down below and let
me know which outfit you think is most
suitable for the event I know that the
event is on the same day as Iran's but
