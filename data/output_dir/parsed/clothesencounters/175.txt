everyone is ijen and welcome back today
I am doing my top 10 items of 2015 and
it's going to arrange from skincare
beauty hair to miscellaneous and a lot
of these items I've mentioned before in
previous videos and even in videos in
2014 but I just thought I would just put
them all together in this giant holy
grail items video so let's just jump
right into it I'm just going to start
off with skincare products and this
product is no stranger to you it is
vanilla cozy clean at zero and it is my
favorite cleansing balm this is what I
use to take off all my makeup and it
just comes as like a solid balm and you
scoop it up with this little spoon guy
and then you just kind of slather it all
over your face and then it dissolves all
my makeup off is just the first step to
my skincare routine and I discovered
this while I was in Korea last spring
and I've been using ever since then this
is actually my second tub so it is very
much loved next up is none other than SK
2's facial treatment essence and this is
another product that I've spoken about
multiple times before and I'm at an age
where I invest in my skincare routine
and that's why I use essence and I apply
this after I use toner and this
basically just provides all the
essential amino acids and proteins and
anti-aging properties that you need for
your face and yeah I've been using it
for a good two years and I feel like my
skin has never been happier I don't
break out very often and I feel like
it's keeping some wrinkles at bay I hope
a good dupe by here for the SK 2 facial
treatment essence is Misha's essence
which is a quarter of the price and
apparently has the same components as SK
2 1
I'm sure there's like slight differences
so if you want more of an affordable
option definitely check out Misha's
essence my last skincare favorite is
Murad's anti-aging moisturizer and iwas
going to rave about this in an empties
video because this is my second tube but
I just thought I would put in this video
because this video is coming out sooner
this has been my favorite day came to
use for the past like 4 months and I've
been loving it because I live in LA
where the Sun is pretty much out every
single day
a and the Sun is very harsh on your face
and I want to preserve my face the best
it can and that's why I like using this
one it is anti-aging it has SPF 30 it's
very lightweight and it absorbs super
quickly into the skin unfortunately it
does have like that quintessential
sunscreen smell but it fades pretty fast
and it's just you know which is
something that I got used to and Ben is
also a big fan of this as well because
it doesn't leave his face looking all
you know cuz I know some sunscreens can
just make you look really like Priest up
it doesn't do that now I'm just going to
jump on to some of my favorite hair
products and tools and I get a lot of
questions about how I style my hair and
pretty much the only tool I use is dry
bars a three-day bender and this is the
1.25 inch barrel and this is an
interesting tool because the clamp
rotates so it does take you know a
couple of tries to really nail the
technique but once you have that down
your hair is just gonna look bomb for
days if you don't have to wash your hair
every single day this product is
definitely the tool for you I personally
love it because every day your hair
looks different
so the first day when you first curl it
on fresh hair it just kind of gives you
just like a nice tight curl it's really
beautiful
love it and then you fall asleep with
that watching hair very gently and then
day 2 your hair will look you know the
waves would have softened and you just
kind of have like a more relaxed curl so
that's like the second hairstyle and
then if you make it to day 3 without
washing your hair then it just looks
like really nice and blown out my hair
can last up to three or even four days
without washing it and I feel like I
feel like you guys are grossed out now
but whatever I'm gonna get into my next
product then you won't be so grossed out
I just want to make it clear that I wash
my body every single day I just put my
hair in a shower cap and then you know
I'll do my thing and I keep my hair on
check by using dry shampoo which leads
me to my next product which is L'Oreal's
fresh dust dry shampoo and this was
recommended to me by my friend and
hairstylist annalee so yeah she got me
hooked on this I am a huge supporter of
dry shampoos and it keeps my roots
looking more
fresh it absorbs any oil and it makes my
hair a little bit more voluminous my
last hair product is or BAE's dry
texturizing spray and this is another
recommendation by Anna Lee so you know
it's really good and this is basically a
product that just gives your hair so
much volume and I'll just spray some on
my hair right now because it could use
it yeah so you just kind of spray on the
ends and then it just makes your hair
look a little bit more thick like look
before and after I love the fact that
this just gives your hair instant
fullness and it smells so good moving on
to fragrances the perfume of the year
goes to C by Chloe and as you can tell
I'm nearly running out of this bottle
but luckily I've got two backups in that
drawer right there I just love the way
the smells it's very like light feminine
kind of sweet and fruity
you just have to sniff it for yourself
at like Sephora or any department store
you go to I just love it this is
definitely my signature scent and one
con about this is the fact that it
doesn't really stick on very long it may
be like lasts for an hour and that's it
maybe it will Winker a little bit longer
depending on what I'm wearing like let's
say I'm wearing like a knit sweater then
the scent will last a little bit longer
so that's a bummer
I do have the rollerball but I feel like
it's still like isn't as like strong as
I want it to be but yeah love this
fragrance give it a sniff let me know
what you think for my makeup favorite I
have none other than my lorac Pro
palette this has been my favorite for a
few years now and as you can see there's
just a lot of dents in this palette I've
hit pan on three colors this has eight
matte shades and eight shimmer shades
and you can really create so many
different makeup looks with this and
with all the palettes I have I just just
I'm just always drawn to this one if I'm
traveling I'll pick this one if I need
like a certain blending color I'll go
back to this palette I just love this
this is kind of a palette that every
girl needs in their life alright so I'm
gonna switch gears and I'm gonna be
chatting about my favorite water bottle
this is
I can teen from Camelbak and if been
watching my channel since 2014 and this
might be familiar because I mentioned it
in a favorites video I don't remember
what month but I definitely definitely
did a shout-out on it and yeah I drink a
ton of water and this bottle is probably
the reason why like I love the way the
water is like dispensed through a straw
so you just like clamp or like bite on
the valve and then the water just comes
up you can even like drink water laying
down with this the option is there this
pretty much comes with me everywhere
whether I'm working out if I'm hiking
it's like on my bedside table like on my
desk like it just it's just everywhere
and I love it it also comes in a ton of
different colors so if peach isn't very
appealing to you you can just get
another one and yeah I think everybody
should have a water bottle because it
just reduces your ecological footprint
and it's something nice to have my last
item is a pair of sunglasses and it was
so hard just picking one pair but I had
to decide on these ones by gentle
monster and I got these in Korea last
spring and I've been rocking ever since
and I like the style because it reminds
me of the ones that Selene has but I
feel like this fits like my agent a
sweater like gentle monster is a Korean
brand so I feel like they've really
nailed sunglasses for Asian faces and I
love the fact that it really goes with
every single outfit I wear whether I'm
glamming it up or bumming it down I just
think they're just a really chic touch
to every look that concludes my top 10
items for 2015 and I know that was like
a lot of overlap of the items that I've
used in the past but I just thought it'd
be good and organized to have everything
