well I hello there my name is Jen I am
filming a haul today which means that
you'll be watching all today I hope you
don't mind this is basically just a
bunch of stuff that I accumulated over
the past month and I thought I would
show you I have an inkling that this
will be kind of a long episode so I'm
just gonna jump right into it so the
first webstore me talking about a the
store called plunder and I'm certain
you've seen at least one plunder hall
from learning four favorite gurus so you
guys are probably familiar with the site
but if not it's just a really it's it's
basically just a web store that sells a
bunch of Awesome brands like mink pink
Motel style soccer for really cheap
prices so this is what I got there the
first item I have is this gorgeous
holiday red sweater and I love that it's
cropped because that means that I can
wear my high waisted things without
having to tuck anything in and it's got
this really cute cable knit detail on
the chest region and it is a bit holey
on the sleeves and a portion of the
chest but that just means I'm just gonna
have to layer this
I think it's Wonder like this is perfect
for family occasions where you have to
look quite demure and not too flashy
well at least my family my next item is
this pleather moto jacket from Members
Only I had no idea that Members Only
designed for women to you I thought they
only do it for men regardless it's just
a really nice structured moto jacket
that is gonna go in my collection I love
the quilting on the back shoulders as
well as the front and I am totally
addicted to lapels it is it is absurd
it's absolutely absurd I have this
leopard dress it's kind of like a Snow
Leopard pattern which is something I
don't really have I usually have warm
toned leopard type of things but I'm
really excited have this cool tone one
because I can accessorize it with silver
jewelry I have a craft in a suit silver
jewelry these days so it's nice to have
something that's cool tone there's a
little cutout in the back which is cute
there is a slightly tulle lining
underneath the dress so it kind of has a
bit more structure to it which is nice
next item is this acid-washed denim
jacket I love that it's fitted but I'm
still able to sneak in a few layers
probably a Cardian or a really thin
hoodie underneath and
I have this desire to customize it I
don't think I'm gonna set it but maybe
I'll kind of decorate it with some
patches or something I bought a bunch of
patches on eBay and I have yet to glue
them on to anything so maybe this will
be a good staple piece because it just
fits really well so it's just open for
customization I'm delving into some
serious sweater territory I'm holding
the silver sweater from style stalker
and it's got a bit of length to it which
is cool because I mean sometimes you
don't want to tuck it in you know I just
want to let it all hang out and it's
very loose-fitting it's kind of
oversized but the sleeves are nice and
fitted which is nice and I like how the
sweater is substantial it's not like
this flimsy ones I feel like this would
be able to retain a lot of warmth
especially once I layer the crap out of
it
the next item you might find a little
bit odd but I have something in mind
with it it looks kind of hoochie on the
hanger but I have a outfit in mind with
this it's basically a bodysuit and I
thought it came with a dress but no no
no no I love that sub I see because this
is very very fitted so it just kind of
seamlessly tucks into your pants so
there's no weird bumps going on around
your stomach area I picked out this kind
of khaki rucksack it kind of like a
cargo pant but I really like the feel of
it it's got one strap on it and I just
think it's like a cool carry out to have
around and it is by alternative apparel
I believe it's just kind of like your
ultimate bucket bag you can just kind of
stuff on your crap inside rank up the
cord and grab the strap and you're on
your way pretty much first off I have
scoliosis so purses are kind of a no-go
for me but I'm always on the hunt for a
really cute backpack so I picked out
this cute little leather one or I think
it's pleather I believe there's no
zipper on this so you just kind of stuff
like a crop in you pull the cord and
you're good to go I guess and once again
it's got kind of like that earthy theme
to it which I really enjoy I got one
item from this web store called virgos
lounge and it is this black dress that
is crossed at the neck and it has a
bunch of these gold baubles or studs all
over the dress and I just think it's a
really cute holiday piece it's got a bit
of volume to it because there's a lot of
tulle on the bottom
but not too much tool so you don't look
like a complete ballerina or something
but I just think it's a really classy
piece I think this is the type of dress
that shows the skin at the right places
the back is kaput completely covered and
there's just a little modest cutout here
Nasty Gal is having a sale so I just
kind of stopped piled on some basics
that I needed I got these cropped
long-sleeve or I guess quarter length
sleeves because I wanted to layer these
underneath my crop sweaters because I
didn't because all my thermals that I
have are too long but these are quite
perfect for it and I think they just act
as a good foundation piece when I'm
wearing really loud pants another piece
is just this nude crop top
obviously I probably can't wear in this
weather maybe I can get away with it in
LA I love the huge neckline and it's
just a really nice soft jersey material
and it's just gonna be a really good
basic for when it gets warmer my last
item is this fancy romper that I'm
probably gonna wear for the holidays I'm
just alone how it folds up the chest
part and it's got pockets in it which is
nice you have the option to wear a belt
if you'd like and the back is completely
exposed I think it's interesting how
although it's a romper or play suit it
still looks really you know formal and
put together I'm gonna put the items
that are available online in the
description bar as well as what I'm
wearing right now if you have an
Instagram my username is I'm genom if
you'd like to follow me that'd be great
I hope you guys enjoy the hall and I'll
talk to you guys in next video bye
