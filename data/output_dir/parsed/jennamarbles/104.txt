I'm gonna get my throat ready um if you
couldn't tell I kind of lost my voice
somehow I don't know how I just woke up
and it's gone it's like instead of the
tooth fairy
the sea witch came visited me and took
my voice thanks Perce Allah do I
get to marry a prince though I sound
like the gabbie show hi Gabi the reason
Pistor eat so if you can bear with me I
would still like to make a video today
every week I ask on my facebook what you
guys want to see for me and sometimes I
just ignore it and make thoughts for my
bathtub like I did last week I like no
one asked for this week I really wanted
to do something that someone wanted I
don't know why I'm still using Facebook
also by the way it's Zuckerberg world
and we're all just living in it I'm a
sucker sucker ah even if I don't have a
voice I could still make dad jokes
someone by the name of natalka ELISA
Xavier suggested quotes second puberty
the struggle no one warned you about I
just started dying laughing when I read
that because it's just so unbelievably
true like for example I thought when you
know I was a teenager whatever there you
go through puberty one time and then you
you know reach your final form like
you're some sort of butterfly you're an
adult and then you're old like they're
very concrete stages I didn't really
understand that this adult puberty thing
happens everything is getting so
weird and it doesn't show any signs of
stopping so for all of you out there
going through actual teenage puberty
don't worry it gets weirder and it just
keeps happening if you're pregnant or if
you have a kid obviously your body does
very different things but I have either
of those so what's my body's excuse no
one warned me for this this is also not
meant to minimize the transgender
community you actually do go through
sort of eight second puberty maybe you
can laugh at all of us over here that
are not transgender and just have it
easy by comparison this is just me
whining about things that I guess aren't
even the worst but they're the worst my
first experience with adult puberty has
been that all of a sudden I just break
out for no reason like just when you
sort of figure out your skin right it's
dry in some places oily in other places
and it takes your like a decade to
figure out what it needs and then right
when you figure it out your skin goes a
weird switch things up your foreheads
like hey I'm done doing this I want to
do something else and your chin is like
I've already been
doing something else I decided like a
week ago I don't I'm gonna do my own
thing and then your lips are like bye
and then your eyes are like we want to
look sad all the time
entire like waking up and breathing air
makes me break out I feel like a lot of
adults second puberty just has to do
with your skin for example last week
when I was in the bathtub making a video
now granted I was in the bathtub for a
little while but I came out I have rash
why am I getting a rash I've been using
these things for a long time I've never
gotten a rash before why am I getting a
rash now it's like your skin just
decides that it doesn't want to be part
of the team anymore it wants to go
against the team my chest was edgy I had
to put each stuff on it I never have to
use it stuff it was a disaster feel like
when I was 15 I could just bathe for
days on end and now I just I can't like
how you get wrinkles on your face you
know I don't mind laughs lines though
those are the only things I'm not gonna
mind because at least that means you
were a fun person and not like
stone-cold bitch your entire life so if
you meet someone they don't have any
laugh lines you know that person was not
very fun at all you also used to be able
to gain and lose a little bit of weight
here and there and everything was fine
but now your body is like you know what
we're gonna keep a permanent souvenir
from this experience here's a stretch
mark and it's yours to keep forever to
remember this time of gluttony you're
welcome
your body also somehow decides that it
doesn't want to be efficient with food
anymore it's like your body turns into a
hoarder oh you need some lasagna I like
lasagna I'm gonna keep it I'm gonna keep
it right here my skirts my favorite I'm
gonna put it right here like to the side
of your boob you eat a baked potato and
then the back of your leg is like I want
to be that another thing about adult
puberty it's not like you can just go
run anymore you just go like oh I got to
catch this thing I'm gonna catch a bus
go run for it no I need to stretch
before I run and probably have dirt for
when I hurt myself from running I mean
I'm an athletic person but I still have
to stretch before and after I run or
else my body will fall apart also no one
warned me how much my body was gonna
hurt I thought that maybe when you were
middle-aged your knees and stuff that
starts going experience pain from that
no go play catch for 20 minutes feel
this pain all week I was writing for
like no more than four minutes the other
day and
I got a cramp in my hand I used to write
for hours feel like you've betrayed us I
will literally just go to sleep that's
all I did and my neck will hurt why does
my neck hurt first puberty is like
growing pains and second puberty is just
like being pains and then I guess when
you're older you just get dying pains
this up is so dark oh my
god no one ever warned me that my feet
now require a certain amount of support
same thing with bras I can't just pick
out a bra and wear it
I need a bra that supports me and not
just gross me all day but supports me
also like a relationship another thing
that bothers me is like why am i
sweating from just sitting here I'm not
doing anything I'm not exerting anything
why am i sweating in second puberty
you're tired all day but then you're
awake all night it's like a cruel joke
it's also the first time that I've ever
experienced my feet getting swollen on a
plane do I need to get circulation socks
that they make like for old people do I
need to get those why am i feet getting
swollen another fun thing that happens
is that sometimes your knees hurt or
your ankles hurt because it's raining
outside oh I think it's gonna rain no I
really I'm serious I feel it in my ankle
it's like it's gonna pull her no one
ever warned me that things were just
gonna start cracking my you hear
that thank you do you that is that
you get lots of little reminders that
you weren't in fact superhuman when
you're a younger person just getting
weird wrinkles all over your body but
also weird moles all over your body that
just show up even though you haven't
been in the sunlight anytime recently in
years totally should have put on
sunscreen the whole time bitch we go on
a Florida okay I'm getting a tip the
first puberty you're an animal in like
gym class and in second puberty you're
an animal at a buffet at first puberty
you'll just start crying for no reason
and in second puberty that never ends no
one ever told me that that part never
ends I'm okay with it the more people
around the better like why go cry in the
bathroom and you can just stand there it
openly cry in like a crowded space as
loud as you can - no one ever told me
that in second puberty you can just
develop a random allergy the guy lots of
people like that all of a sudden they're
twenty five and they're allergic to
coconut like what if my throat right now
I just I ate something and I'm allergic
to it and I'm just
I have to deal with it or you were
allergic to something and now you're not
I used to have asthma now I don't my
body was just like look lugs you're
taking up too much attention okay
somebody else needs attention team why
are we sweating needs attention right
now I swear on my life after like 25
years old I can't hear anyone anymore
Julian will say things to me ten times
in a row and I just can't hear
you I'm sorry I'm listening I just can't
hear you what the are you saying
don't even get me started in like a bar
because I'll go what and then I just go
yeah I have good hearing too I piss all
those testicle BP just real life
function doesn't work during first
puberty all I wanted was like really
long nails and I would try hard to grow
them out and they would always break and
now I can grow my nails like as long as
I want they're just really ugly looking
unless I get them done and stuff get
accused of having crack nails like Jenna
cut that pinkie nailed crack nail guess
be careful what you wish for because you
don't know what kind of nails you're
gonna get another fun thing that happens
in second puberty is that you can no
longer regulate your body temperature
I'm always freezing cold Jillian's
always burning hot if I put on like a
sweatshirt I'm too hot I have no control
over what temperature my body is
Julian's had some second puberty
experiences that I will now share with
you without his consent for example he
got excited one time because he grew a
chest hair that he didn't have before he
also makes dad noises whenever he sits
down or stands up which I don't think
anyone does until their second puberty
uh and then he'll go oh he also just
breathes really love yeah that's what my
second puberty has been like so my
favorite I don't really like it I don't
know where my voice is my skin's
breaking out all over the place
my body is hoarding food it's annoying I
don't like it so I can off just
kidding I love me I love you so yeah let
me know if you have any of these sanal
feels so weird over here because no one
told me to expect this and I feel like I
got lied to I thought I supposed to be a
butterfly right now and it said I'm like
a one winged moths like I can't find a
face cream that works for me make sure
you subscribe to my channel I put out
new videos every Wednesday I'm sorry
again for my voice being so rude
Kilis I'll see you next week bye friends
all right
uh I gotta go
