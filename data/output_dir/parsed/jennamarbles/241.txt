hello little barking so today is not
gonna be a very funny video as you can
probably tell from the title so if
you're here for the sexual list you can
click away I'll see you next week fuckin
disclaimer but I wanted to make this
video because it is probably one of the
most requested videos I've ever gotten
since I started on YouTube and that is
being yourself I have in the past
addressed some of this but I've never
dedicated an entire video to just the
topic being yourself
and I really want to do that because
it's really important to me many of you
are younger than me but for those of you
that are my peers or older than me and
wiser and smarter than me feel free to
chime in at any point I in theory
understand why so many of you have asked
me how to be yourself because I do have
a very strong sense of self the idea of
being yourself is an incredibly hard
thing because first of all who the fuck
am i well maybe I would be myself if I
knew who I was quote-unquote
everyone any brain you're like alright I
know who my friend is she's that person
I know who my mom is she's that person
but pull amok and I believe that you
become yourself every single day of your
life through your choices and how you
think and that's constantly changing
every day you are different and hating
people say things like are you haven't
changed a bit
well the fucking that doesn't even make
any sense maybe there are some things
about me that have stayed the same maybe
I still think all cats are on the
internet or funny it is select petting
other people's dogs but you are
constantly changing evolving through
your experiences how you interpret your
experiences and how you choose to do
things in the future based on those
experiences to condense that a little
bit I think that being yourself means
that you think with your own mind and
you make your own choices and that makes
you you that makes you an individual
that makes you different than everyone
else and the single greatest gift you
could ever give the world is to be
exactly who you are and that that is
your whole journey here on planet earth
as a human in the human experience so
first of all you don't know how to be
yourself that's okay because maybe you
don't know who you are and be
son my sort of definition of being
yourself as speaking for yourself and
making your own choices to actually be
yourself is an incredibly lonely thing
because there is only one of you you are
the only you that there is you're the
most rare and majestic you there ever
was and ever will be maybe there's other
use in other dimensions maybe your
spirit was like another spirit another
you who knows but for right now in this
moment you are you and you're the only
you that there is so naturally is going
to be very lonely sometimes to be you
when all your friends are doing
something so I should probably do it too
is always a little bit easier to do what
everyone else is doing and that never
changes throughout your whole life is
very hard to do something completely
different just because you fix up
because humans are social creatures
right we need each other
we need to feel acceptance so that's
sort of like the animal part of you
that's like ok I leave the pack if I
will break off and do my own thing over
here I'm in isolation I might die
because I don't have my group around me
it's a very unsure feeling I mean you
should see marbles when if I take carbon
out of the house and leave marbles he
freaks out he thinks the pack left him
I'm gonna die you're like the little
bird that got kicked out of the nest or
you're like the little bird that's like
see you guys later it flew out of the
nest you see it gives you crazy
what are scary feelings in life being
alone doing something wrong being
embarrassed failing it's easier if
you're a group of people that you're
doing it with to do something wrong to
fail to feel embarrassed if you're with
other people it somehow takes it off of
you and you don't have to feel all of
the fields you only feel
little bit of the fields when you break
off and do something by yourself you're
scared of the isolation failure is
sadness the loneliness the embarrassment
all those things and the only one that
there is you it's really fucking scary
but in order to find out who you are you
will at some point have to feel really
isolated left out different you know
that feeling when you like cry that
really ugly cried your mouth is like a
Lego Rover bad better usually
I guess pretty good like that there's
like snot coming out of your nose and
you have to feel like that you have to
feel like am I taking crazy pills that's
how you know that you're doing it right
you have to get to that point sometimes
where you're like I'm the only one that
feels this way I must be crazy and so
I'm just going to keep doing it because
fuck you guys because in my opinion
teams are great groups of people are
great to help you figure out who you are
and what you fit into in terms of
whatever but for a lot of people when
they lose the things that they identify
with for example if you're an athlete
and then your career is over Who am I
fuck am I this thing that I identified
with is no longer part of me Who am I
that's when you have to dig into
yourself make your own choices think
your own thoughts do your own thing
that's when you figure out who you are
before you even make any more of this
video I just want to share something
with you because maybe you are going
through one of those times right now
maybe you have recently maybe you will
sue but like Young Jana started doing
this I don't know how or why but it
would always make me feel so much better
and I've used it ever since just want to
tell you what it is whatever young shy
scared nervous Jenna was in one of those
really sad cry like rubber band mouths I
feel so alone and lonely being myself
right now in a corner little Jenna would
close her eyes and imagined her future
self stay with me I would imagine my
future self this like older cooler smart
more awesome version of myself would
calm down like I'm a spaceship be like
hey there little Jenna guess what
everything is gonna be just fine and you
know what you're sad right now
sucks but it's gonna help you be who
you're supposed to be and you have to go
through this so that you can be cool
awesome future Jenna that's here I know
I say that well I'm smiling but it is a
very serious thing and I feel like I do
it all the time when I'm feeling sad or
lonely and I don't know what I'm doing I
don't know where I'm going I imagine the
cool awesome future version of myself
just telling my present self okay you
just got a fucking grab that giraffe by
its ears and just ride it out you know
because if your life was all happy and
awesome like of all the really cool
musicians and my people that you look up
to and think are so awesome they would
not be themselves if they didn't sit in
the corner and cry about it sometimes if
they felt so weird and alone when want
you to do for the next time you're in
that weird like I don't know who I am or
I'm trying to figure out who I am are
being myself but it feels weird
just fucking picture your bad ass future
self coming down and like petting me
like a little kitty saying you know what
you want to be cool badass future you
you got to just cry about it okay you
got to feel weird because then you're
gonna feel awesome someday everything's
gonna be out and you feel like this
petting feels good and the other thing I
want to say about being yourself either
there are some things about you that you
wish were a little different think of
someone maybe it's your dad or someone
in your community that's really kick-ass
that you wish that you could be like you
know maybe you wish you were more
generous or more giving more helpful all
just go be that maybe that person that
you really look up to is really kind and
caring and always listens to you when
you have a problem if you want to be
like someone there is nothing stopping
you from modeling yourself after someone
else you don't have to be them that's
not your job in life your job in life is
not to be someone else you just want to
be as good being you as that person is
at being them if that makes any sense I
promise you that as weird and awful and
terrible as it may seem to be yourself
sometimes it will always reward you for
example some benefits of bitter self
include you know that the people that
love you love you for you they don't
love you for who they think you are or
who you're
to be something my mom said to me when I
was a little girl I was really upset I
think I just had a fight with a friend I
was sitting on the bathroom at just
crying and I was like I just wish that I
didn't care and my mom looked at me and
was like you know what I'm 25 years old
Jenna and I still care and if you ever
figure out how to not care tell me
because I wish I didn't care either
about a lot of things you can always
care you probably will care when you're
making your own choices and doing your
own thing occurrence that you suck some
people are like what are you doing like
so stupid you can still care don't let
it dictate your choices and what you
want what you want to accomplish out of
life who you want to be don't let anyone
get in the way of that that's being
yourself don't ever ever ever ever give
up because you are here for a reason
even if it's just to laugh at cats on
the internet you'll figure it out
apologize for the long set sappy video
if this is not the thing that you like
on my channel but I need to make it okay
because it's important to me and I just
wanted to tell you that I love you and
being yourself is hard right for me
purposes I only know how to be Kermit I
don't know how to be anything else do I
mean but make sure you subscribe to our
