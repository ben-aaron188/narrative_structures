so I don't see the title of this video
so just disclaimer this is really just a
normal regular video like we're just
having one of those days I don't even
really feel like being on camera today
Julie I just got back from a trip I miss
him so much you remember six days and he
brought home some lovely sickness I feel
like I'm getting a little sick too but
Julian is like sick right now and all I
want to do is take care of my god I'm
sick and I also I'm just having one of
those days where I was like I want to
curl up at the blanket what's your
favorite Thai food to eat on those days
sue I mean I don't need any kind of date
to meet super I've made a couple of
cooking videos in the past on this
channel like obviously and Julian's
channel we've done lots of cooking
videos but I was surprised that you guys
wanted to watch that even if we are like
you know fucking around the whole time
because I feel like some of you guys are
genuinely interested in what we eat has
to vegans one of which has celiac just
music can't eat wheat also because it
seems really complicated but I promise
you it's not and so I think people are
also kind of curious what we eat and so
I'd say this is like our go to sick meal
this is absolutely Julian's like
favorite favorite soup and I'd say it's
one of my favorite soups just like
really warm and comforting and it's
perfect good for the days when you just
don't want to be or the first time that
I made this recipe was for Julian wooden
dogs with some teeth out and I chalked
everything like super tiny so he could
eat it but the recipe is I found on
Pinterest
it's from connoisseurs veg it's just a
hot and sour soup that we've adjusted a
little bit to make it vegan and gluten
free and it's really easy for those of
you they're here for crazy stuff from
sorry I'm having a human day where I
just need some soup and they spend some
time with my Julie and this is our
salmon guys whenever you need a mom
everybody needs a hook today really bad
so because this isn't a cooking channel
this is real life all of the ingredients
are not prepared and neat little dishes
and you just dump them together that's
always like my least favorite part of a
cooking video it's like well you just
skipped over the pony part that takes
like the most bok choy scam
two green onions cilantro shiitake
mushrooms ginger garlic vegetable oil
tofu oh my god
okay chili paste and stuff that goes in
the soy sauce yeah I'll bet we pressed
our tofu overnight so it's all dried out
this is the total press it's like my
favorite thing in the kitchen because
you put maybe put the tofu in here for
like overnight and then it comes out
completely dried to where you can like
fry it and it gets nice and crisp I've
also been watching a lot of June's
kitchen and just the other day he made
his own tofu and I wish I didn't do that
but alas I'm having a date where I'm not
a person I like I'm like on the littler
side like you can pick it okay you can
pick it up with a spoon
and not like open your mouth juice
what's going on you have to have a pre
chop ritual otherwise what are you doing
what is it's all been about last week
one of the lights went out and we're
still getting both I'm so sorry man is
just not in the cards for today this is
a perfect soup for when you're having a
day like this because I know you have
days like this too it serves perforce
well they should be cute so now that you
made on that small link why should that
small width wise or else they're not
good even I'm done with some rectangular
I know this was a fun relationship but
sometimes you need to break up that tofu
you can do these at the same time but I
just want to do the tofu just easier
just put in some oil in a pan and then
you basically price the tofu so that it
gets nice and brown so the ones in the
soup it's like chewy and not like super
soft it's really good while that's going
do they do you want to cut this we need
having a day like this as long as it
gets cooked it's a
you mean between both burrs and when it
comes to the cut is Julian's favorite
soup but it usually has like sneaky
wheat in it like soy sauce and what else
they put like a flower in the secondary
we do cook for ourselves an awful lot
kind of out of necessity even though we
live in a very vegan friendly place but
I was so surprised the last couple of
videos we did where we are cooking late
so many people were tweeting at me like
pictures of them making it oh look I
could think anyone was actually gonna
make it we're like here it's so cool I
got so many sick sizes too big beef
you're gonna pull those down you're
gonna pull my chin so we're just gonna
use extra box right I'm like one extra
scallions
six or seven is it like one box choice
and then a smaller cup of cilantro and 4
ounces of shiitake mushrooms
please give your Ares boyfriend a night
and just let him get all of this
frustration that you love that like what
a nice it but this is Mayombe Japanese
steel I don't know the exact model it's
kind of like worn off got these little
grooves in here so when you're cutting
something with moisture
it doesn't like stick to the food bend
it up I'm gonna go ahead and burn myself
hide I know a lot of people don't like
cilantro but I love cilantro some people
taste so I taste don't want you gonna
take your hamburger buns and you haven't
touched so these are mushrooms yummy I
think you're funny thanks you're on a
date I mean I like your new blinds a
little while or whatever the garlic's
amount says just do it Julie in the
mouth which is like twice that you're
not gonna chop the garlic cuz I'm tired
maybe instead of pointing out Brady
right now we can homie sit down a half
then we can lay a candle on whole pants
the whole package so this pot is too big
for this another like tablespoon oil but
sometimes we double this recipe so it's
good if you double it or you want
leftovers having a dually in this will
probably serve us one time March bring
that light over here it's so bright
we're just gonna we're bringing this to
a boil this is about how much soup we're
working with
it's eight cups of broth but it's like
Julian's gonna eat once now in Weston
two hours then it's Candy Doll just let
it boil
someone's touching my bar with it yeah
me too bitch thank you for helping mommy
make soup it's not for you you get your
- marble come get your doll slap on the
floor you can do it I believe in you you
can do it oh you need a little more
encouragement love was I believe in you
lower the heat when I add some mushrooms
splash them over Julian thank you
you let this cook for another 10 minutes
so we didn't go like cold again yeah
this is Kermit's marble is still eating
but I am finished Stan's
we stand there and pretend not to stare
at him the whole time
watch it face the wall that's my
favorite when your boss watch I like you
you can't get him to move from there
either until marbles and stuff this is
the magic right here this race the
vinegar makes it that sour flavor so
it's two tablespoons of dat two
tablespoons of sambal or I like Asian
chili piece it's really good when you
don't feel good
many some spice and some ginger and a
tablespoon of soy so if you want to make
it gluten free use tamari or gluten-free
soy sauce a tablespoon of sugar do you
think we got a tablespoon we bet it cuz
I'm not going to the store ooh rip it
then you let this cook for another 10
minutes
and then we add in all the green stuff
and the Tulsa what's happened know how
many tablespoons Oh No
two tablespoons of cornstarch in a
quarter of a cup of cold water make sure
you get cornstarch all over your pants
your shirt and the counter okay let's
use bacon always easy contract if you're
ever out of

beautiful it just got very purple in
here oh I'll be honest a good it's
really good firm I talk a little bit

if you slurp at the decibel level that
is equivalent to the age of the oldest
cook in the kitchen you get everything
for free anywhere for the rest of your
life
Julian first of all it's amazing
second of all it's amazing sorry mom
it's just like looking so - yeah I'm not
a super fan of how you chopped up this
bok choy Julie Clark is this long and
dangling yeah I can put some scissors in
that bowl real quick what what are these
notices they're saying people good gosh
nobody so good oh shit is that a
boomerang
I appreciate that you guys let me make
videos sometimes artists like oh no life
and not involving a hot glue gun
whatsoever sometimes you just need to
spend time with your out and make soup
you know what I mean
I already said I don't want to go to ER
I'm a knight or what candle burn he is
not doing anything I know this isn't the
most exciting thing in the world but I
like watching cooking videos a lot I
find them to be really relaxing and I
needed to relax with my hotter today who
is slowly getting me sicker and sicker

hope that you find any of this enjoyable
or helpful or inspired you to make some
delicious soup you know what time it's a
bad time the headphones though literally
