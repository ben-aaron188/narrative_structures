hi friends so last night we were last
night we went to the streamys and I was
presenting the award for an attorney of
the year and I was rudely interrupted by
vitaliy trying to show everyone penis
and then didn't and then nobody cared
about anything that happened I was
standing behind him so I wouldn't have
seen his penis anyway penis there's a
chance even if he was facing you you
might not hahahahaha but there's a
couple reasons why I wanted to make this
video one I met Christine of
Neurological last night she is an
incredible internet goddess she has
sexualized nail polish to a point I
didn't think was possible I'm a hollow
sexual I'm sexually attracted to nail
polish forever I mean not really but
like sort of I think she might really be
though in case you have noticed I've
been falling down all these Beauty holes
and she is actually the creator of all
those hundred layers challenges she's
like the internet that I signed up for
basically the second reason I wanted to
make this video is that in this month
alone I have been nail shamed so many
times I can't even tell you first of
which was at my best friend's wedding
I got nail shamed into getting a
manicure at the beauty salon you're
getting our hair done and the woman
looked at my nails and was like you
can't show up at the wedding like that
and I was like pictures not my wedding
no one cares
after she was done doing my hair she
literally was like you I'm doing your
nails now that's not okay and then she
turned to my friend and was like did you
see her nails and also when I met
Christine last night she was like let me
see your nails and there's nothing on
them because I didn't have time to do
then that's like high key like heavily
embarrassed I was so embarrassed and
like I'm a little tired I'm still kind
of coming down from the whole streamys
experience and I was like you know what
Jeff you just gotta like take it easy go
to the salon sometimes get my nails done
you know treat myself so I decided I was
gonna go to the salon and and have
Julian do my nails so I can kick back
and relax be a pampered lady welcome to
this - salon where no women ever go did
you make an appointment
cuz it's empty in here but I only take
appointments but there are people like
that in the world there's no but yeah
I have done Julian's nails once before
but you've never done my nails have you
ever done anyone sales define nails you
get out of our house science I didn't
tribute of simply Nia logical Christine
Julian is going to attempt to do some
nail art and he's going to do five
different types right what do you decide
like a crisscross crisscross we're doing
los marble which Christine hates by the
way but we're gonna do it anyways we're
doing art freehand okay all right were
you fade then the other one is stencil
oh you did you cut out a center uh no
Hill alright ready
yeah thank you are you ready yeah which
one do you want start with I'm gonna
start with my volcanic starter the
hardest one cherry God can I have my
nail polish please oh I brought you all
you know do not stick that in your hair
look it these nail polishes are actual
hollows you know let me run my salon are
you this is a hollow for your light
Muslim can I tell you what a hollow is
really clear it's when it's reflective
of like rainbow particles got it can you
think about all the colors I baby wait
you're gonna make it an exciting marble
with these three colors maybe the dopest
marble ever so that's it from now on you
don't tell me how that went
wait wait is that not Wayne is I'm sorry
do you have an opinion that way this is
my song you don't get to make creative
choices anymore when you signed up for
this video
and I signed up we gave me everything um
you're gonna basically pour out like
half the bottle into the water
Julian no I wasn't dropped it was pretty
more than a drop it oh my god
no it's not oh are you doing Jenna did
you see her doing that in the video that
you watched
yeah what's like 10 video you're gonna
get it all over it's not gonna be a
pretty circle you know what I think it's
gonna be pretty and also I think now is
nail polish should be judged on the
quality of its character and out it
looks like Julian just trust the process
okay it's too much nail polish
I'm supposed to be like little drops no
it's not here we go
now I want to know here's what we're
gonna do
I don't know Howard like that do I know
you wanna make you do this at home the
answer is no looks so fucked up
oh wow Sebastian okay that was a bad or
give you that cuz you're doing it too
rough you supposed to just do it really
lightly there you go okay now that we're
done just do that where should I do it
are you gonna get rid of all that stuff
so I'm gonna figure out what are we
doing
don't touch my nail don't know just get
rid of stuff in the water taking a
finger there we go Oh oh my god it's so
pretty
no Julian look how much nail polish that
is yeah but it worked
look it it's so thick yeah but no you
use wait look it
oh my god Julian I would just reuse it
and it's all good
oh my god this is coming out amazing
like better than the video that's
disgusting that's never gonna dry Julian
look how much paint that is look at that
that's like its own little polish
Mountain oh no it's not gonna dry but it
looks good that looks like shit tbh it
doesn't give me your other finger we got
work to do go right there that little
store quicker
oh my goodness it's stunning but it's
just sliding off of my finger
you don't watch any of the tutorial I
did I watch them all you saw me watch
them my favorite part about having my
own salon is doing things how I fucking
want what are you typing with my the top
of my finger that's where my nail ends
right there it looks exactly like how I
pictured alright what's next well you're
done admiring it like I was beautiful
we're doing stencil now you can't just
cut janky shit out of tape and color
gentle it's going to be very intrigued
we're doing a line across each nail
going outward to represent outward
energy here we go we're going to get up
right there this spread is my favorite
because it speaks to the dominant of
audibility
the human spirit what was that we're
gonna download any of the human spirit

over there life is that right so I have
a mustache and a face I mean it's not
the worst can I ask you guys so can you
please write that on Yelp
I've been getting slammed by my
customers on that website
I think the ombre nails are my favorite
they're my favorite really the shop has
some shit hanging from it
thumb the rest do you know what this
looks like this looks like when a
YouTube video gets deleted
oh right and it's like an you're not
yeah that's what this is so out of 11
how did I do
no I'll give you like a solid six and a
half it's not the worry about stressing
out please work done yeah I've
disappointed in the marble nail they're
not red so a lot harder than it looked
okay you just dumped it nail polish into
a cup a lot harder than lush
and it looks really hot you hit me with
some topcoat please so you keep this for
a little letter taco oh we pushed our
luck and we got pushed back by our look
I'm gonna rock this for a little bit
real everyone can get off my back and
shop nail shaming me okay because I got
a manicure from a man a man yeah we had
a lot of fun at the streamys but it's
been a lot today to recover from and I
appreciate you just like hanging out
with me doing my nails I think for
letting me do this so everyone can stop
nail shaming
no more nail shame just you know shaving
- cases like this is so easy you could
do this for me like every week all right
