hey guys today's video I'm just going to
tell you what happened if you saw on
Twitter we let you guys know that we had
gotten in a car accident on Monday and I
really can't make any sort of video
today except for this so I did want to
tell you what happened we are okay
everything is fine I just wanted to tell
you what happened and yeah that's about
it
this is all I can do we really
appreciate everyone reaching out and
giving us well wishes means a lot and
anyone that's been in a car accident you
know it's scary it's not fun and the
last couple days have been miserable but
like not the worst ever because
everything's fine Julie's here to say
Han love we went to buffer festival this
weekend
so Monday we were flying back from
Toronto which was international travel
so I like you know the fastest thing in
the whole wide world we woke up at 4:00
our flight was early in the morning so
we got back to LA at around noon and
we're already very tired
I already don't like flying usually we
would take some sort of like uber or
like bigger car home but this time we
didn't book anything in advance so we
were just gonna take a cab
so Julie and I and Rome all got in line
downstairs at the airport where you get
like a regular taxi should have been
fine and we were in town like noon we're
excited to have the rest of the day to
go and like relax we first of all we
sent Rome in the cab ahead of us because
she was behind us we were like no room
after you go ahead so she was not in the
cab with us and I'm honestly glad that
we got in that cab because she might
have been sitting in the front seat or
whatever
who knows can't think about that stuff
trying not to we get in the cab and it's
a small little like got it out Prius
like there's really nothing in it except
for like the cab wall and like a bench
in the back where Julie and I are
sitting let me set the scene for you
okay so I had my headphones in I was
listening to music and I'm sort of
crouched in the back seat like this you
know not really sitting correctly
Julian was like oh what are you just
gonna listen to music without me and we
live
like it would take a sweat half-hour to
get home so it's not like a short cab
ride you know we're going to be in the
cab for a little bit so I start kicking
back relax and got my headphones in and
Julian's like I want to listen to music
too so I give him the other headphone
and I immediately changed the song to
cupcake deepthroat so it sounded like
this me and we were just like jamming
out it's like both on our phones and we
are on the 405 headed towards our house
in the carpool lane in our Prius and our
driver was just speed demon like it was
like 70 miles an hour 70 miles an hour
and the next thing we know I've remember
the first thing I remember is I heard
him yell because Julie and I are both in
the backseat the car starts like
crashing it feels like it's lasting
forever but apparently either he or the
person next to us because we didn't see
it we were listening to help me one of
them tried to switch lanes and we
collided and there was just like a lot
of crashing happening Julie and I were
both wearing our seat belts and so the
worst of the damage is for me on my knee
I'll show you in a second on my knee
because it was against the wall and
where the seat belts were like
immediately after the crash we like
couldn't breathe like it takes all of
the wind out of you it's like getting
the wind knocked out of you but like
also your neck and your head and your
brain and all of that and so it was
pretty scary and all of us like us and
the taxi driver was like trying to catch
our breaths and like breathe making sure
that your body is okay and I started to
lose consciousness and I don't know
whether it was from like this impact or
like what it was but everything that was
seen was like white couldn't really see
and I felt myself like I could just go
to sleep right now which is terrifying
so mobile so I put my head down between
my legs as far as I could was just
breathing because I'm also prone to just
passing out you know if I see something
scary on TV I'll pass out Julian was
okay and we're trying to see if we're
okay and uh you know we could see the
other drivers just one guy I think his
car and it
just terrifying just really scary
thankfully we were all okay we were all
wearing our seatbelts and the worst
injuries that we have are bruising and
stuff from the actual seatbelts I thank
God as opposed to not having our
seatbelts on or you know there was a big
white SUV behind us the woman and that
is that actually the one that stopped
and called 9-1-1 but you know she could
have rear-ended us it could have been
far worse than it was she actually got
out and was the one that asked us if we
needed paramedics she called 9-1-1 and
she gave me some water which kept me
from passing out but we were able to
just sort of get out of the cab after a
while like once paramedics got there and
stuff and essentially walk away without
any major injuries we went to the
hospital we were there for a long time
we're in the yarra ER Julie and I got
separated so I was in like a sketchy bed
in the hallway and you were like in some
room right oh and also here's another
thing I actually peed my pants leave me
alone like after the car accident
happened and it was sort of like when we
were getting out I realized that I had
actually peed my pants maybe this is TMI
but maybe also just to normalize your
experience if ever happens to you like
it wasn't because I was scared I wasn't
cognizant of it happening it was the
seatbelt like restricting onto my
stomach so hard because I was sitting
kind of like an asshole
so I peed my pants like when the
paramedic was like here have a seat in
the ambulance I was like um sir I
actually peed my pants a little he's
like oh it's gay to worry about it will
clean it up later okay thank you so then
we got to the ER and Julie and I are
separated so it was a little scary and
of course like for those of you that
know me know that I don't like needles
shots I'm okay with but getting blood
drawn and IVs are like nightmare town to
me absolute nightmare so I'm telling
them my injuries I'm like you know my
neck my back my ribs hurt and my knee
hurts and they're like okay and then I
come back and they're like we got it we
got first of all we got to take blood
second of all we're going to need to
hook you up to an IV and put some dye in
your blood so that week
get some contrast and check you for
internal bleeding and I was like oh sick
fucking tight healthy great this day's
just keep getting so much better oh my
god fuck yet finished with Julian they
did x-rays on him you didn't have any
broken bones and they did an x-ray on my
chest and stuff and we've both broken
ribs in the past from playing like
baseball and softball and it feels like
the closest your rib could be too broken
without actually being being broken like
it feels like a broken rib back here I
know you feel that way too which is
terrible it hurts to cough where you the
sneeze all of those things but no broken
bones the nurse came well first a guy
came and he drew blood and I always tell
people drawing my blood in the like
first couple minutes I'm like you know
I'm not good with this I will probably
start crying worst case scenario I might
pass out but I haven't done that in a
long time because I've been getting over
my fear so he drew blood and then the
next nurse came by to hook me up with an
IV and couldn't get this one to work
again and then she did it on this off so
I'm already like just sitting there like
quietly sobbing and I'm like no I'm okay
you can just keep going she couldn't get
this one to work so he had another nurse
come over and hook me up like here so
I'm already just having the worst time
ever
don't Julian's nowhere to be found I
don't know if he's okay whatever but it
was terrifying then he came over
thankfully and was like I'm good but
then the fun part happened I do is it a
CT scan or a cat scan it was a CT scan
so I'm in this big giant circle II
whirly thing and the guy injected some
iodine into my IV and made my blood feel
hot and my mouth tastes like metal but I
had no internal bleeding which was good
and the guy that did my CT scan was like
oh I saw that crash on the 405 was that
you and it was like it was he was like
oh that looked terrible I was like thank
you for understanding sorry appreciate
but nobody checked out my knee and they
almost refused Julian's some like advil
wewe both refused prescription
painkillers ah that's personal choice
I'm just
terrified of them unless I had like a
major surgery so we are trying to just
tough it out with some ibuprofen and ice
and stuff I think we're gonna be okay
yeah I'll show you what happened if
you're a little squeamish just don't
maybe look for some of it but it's
really not that bad
that's where my IV was exhuming were you
losing from IV yeah I bruise it from the
IV v is that bad what does that mean
that means that they were they weren't
good with it there are nurses that know
how to do well on these nurses didn't
yeah well my veins weren't particularly
cooperative I'll show you the bruising
from the seat belt which is best because
it saved our lives so it's like this
part sorry for being a little chubby and
up through my back this one is a little
graphic I might have to blur some fist
because it's on my chest this is a
little graphic I'm trying my best I'm
trying not to show my nipple here but
this this is the bruise on my boobie
from the seat belt I'd say the most
painful right now is my leg still this
is my knee I hit the wall thing right
there and this part is all numb like I
can't feel anything
the pain isn't the worst ever but I'm
having a hard time walking still or
putting weight on this leg so we're just
trying to stay off of it and put ice and
elevate it and stuff but we haven't had
a chance to get like looked at by our
regular doctors and stuff but we're okay
and we're good and that's why this is
kind of all I can make today so I do
apologize for that it's just this what
happens it's life sometimes you get in a
car accident oh and also this is like
some Ultimate Universe fuck shit
Julian's mom bless her came to the
hospital and picked us up and was going
to drive us home because you know a
really fun thing to do after you get in
the car accident is get back into a car
and have to ride 30 minutes back to your
house so Julian asks his mom if she
could maybe try and take side streets
because we just didn't want to get back
on the 405 we were in like Culver City
and all of a sudden we
driving through a police shootout so
there's like a guy standing on the
sidewalk and two cops behind a cop car
both with their guns drawn one of them
had like a big gun and then behind
another corner of another building are
two more cops with guns pointed and no
one's stopping traffic we're just sort
of driving by so Julian's mom pulls into
a gas station but we're like directly in
the line of fire should there actually
be a shootout and I just start like
freaking out that was like my freak out
point of the day like I'd had it
I just gotten off a five-hour flight
international travel getting no car
accident we go to the ER and now I'm in
a police shootout is this day done yet
fuck we're just like in so much pain
when you think your day is gonna be
alright psych psych but you know I still
pencils in my eyebrows today because I'm
still living my best eyebrow life but
yeah that's the update of what's going
on I think we should be good next week
but no like life-altering injuries as
far as we know hopefully my knee turns
out to be okay but it feels alright
we're incredibly lucky always wear your
seatbelt please please if ever you get
in a taxi and you're in the back you
think about not wearing your seatbelt
just maybe remember this and I just hope
that you I think a lot of people are
really good about wearing their
seatbelts and their cars or the friends
cars but maybe not always in a taxi
depending where you live and I know I've
like done it in the past and just never
again nor will I ever get in a taxi if
the seatbelt doesn't work or there isn't
one for me like it's just not worth it
and I'm just so glad and thankful that
we were both wearing ours and that the
driver was and the other driver and they
were both okay as far as we saw although
we seem we got like whisked away and an
ambulance we didn't really I don't
really see the aftermath of anything but
um yeah just
we're glad right up we had like
different injuries so Julian was sitting
upright like a normal person to his like
back and neck really hurts and my like
rib and knee really hurt but we have
like different injuries so we can help
each other I'll be lower body yeah like
right
first day you were like I can do leg
stuff if you can do arm stuff I was like
I can do my arm stuff thanks so much for
all of your well wishes we really
appreciate it and hopefully next week
we'll be back with a regular video and
nothing like this I love you so much
wear your seat belt please where you
sleep out always always always right
good bye
