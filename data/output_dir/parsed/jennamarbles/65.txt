there's a surprise at the end of this
video so fast forward now if you're
heard patience sorry I'm a little under
the weather which is why I wanted to do
another one of these from my bathtub but
you know what I don't feel like thinking
about it I want to lay in my couch and
there's blanket but I still have
thoughts and they still need to just be
put somewhere so instead of thoughts
from a bathtub I'm gonna give you some
thoughts from a couch so here we go
a lot of people are upset about our
current president-elect but repeat after
me the president is not my daddy
he cannot just spank me whenever he
feels like it feel better now I think
that we need to abandon this mission to
Mars business it's been a long time and
it's not going to happen I say we start
terraforming Saturn yeah it's a big
gaseous frozen e planet okay step one we
just inject a bunch of oxygen into it so
then it makes frozen water so that'll be
blast and asteroid to make it closer to
the Sun then what would you get
Waterworld
we're already prepared for that so then
we take a second asteroid and blast it
even farther closer to the Sun and then
we get hot water world then we can send
people to colonize it and fill it with
marine life and then they live in
Waterworld and everyone's a pescetarian
and when you look up in the sky you can
see ratings tight if everybody donated
the ends of their loaves of bread every
week we could feed a lot of hungry
people especially if they're hungry for
shitty sandwiches a lot of states will
find you if you don't go to jury duty
but if we also find people for not
voting feel like we could make enough
money to build a land bridge between
North America and Greenland and then we
could put a bunch of tolls on that road
and we could generate enough income to
start terraforming Saturn if bees are
endangered we should elect one person in
each community to be a beekeeper then
once the bee population goes up don't be
surprised that the human population goes
down from bee stings
you asked for this fake news is all over
Facebook and people are concerned maybe
a simple solution is don't get your news
from Facebook this product has the wrong
name it should be called a give it a
rest already they're not coming vine is
dead but it doesn't have to be here's a
list of billionaires I think we should
convince to keep vine alive or we should
see if they'd be willing to take Tom
from myspace as a blood sacrifice
because I know what billionaires want
and it's Tom I think someday future
humans will look back and say why are
they pooping and peeing into fresh water
I think cars should have directional
horns so you could backwards beep at a
car that was tailgating you or diagonal
beep at a squirrel that wasn't paying
attention or upbeat but a tree full of
birds just a scarab because why not
I think the punishment for mistreating
animals should be being thrown into a
pit of gorillas too soon too late we
could get rid of rush hour by making
half the population nocturnal half the
people work regular hours and half the
people work Batman hours if you go up to
a snake and you hug it all the time it
dies because you smothered it that's
what you're doing to your relationship
what is armpit hair for what is it for
you know I think Ariel from The Little
Mermaid really was just a hoarder who
else collects trash like that the NSA is
spying on me good someone else will have
to listen to all this relentless barking
- I had head lice 6 times when I was
little I mean think about that that's an
impressive statistic if this hairstyle
is called a bob then why isn't this
hairstyle called a Robert get it because
this one's short for
Wow one time my friend skipped a rock on
a lake and it hit a goose and the goose
spun around upside down for a little
while I mean name a more iconic duo I'll
wait
I think dogs like to play fetch because
well they're stupid drums should be
called banks and banks should be called
regret why does the government get to
tell me how many dogs I'm allowed to
have and speaking of dogs bark bark
that's a cute bonnet and speaking of
bonnets it's time for the surprise the
video is over so four months ago I
released a set of pop sockets
they were galaxies Carmen and marbles
and the regular Kermit and marbles and
they're gone now because I told you they
were limited edition do I look like some
of the last cuz I wasn't lying but the
good news is I have four more new pups I
did there's a tie dye Carmody marbles in
sunglasses there's Carmen and models and
sunglasses on a rainbow beach there's
Carmen and marbles holding hands and
spades and last but not least my
personal favorite Kermit's awkward
school page I've been dying to put this
on my phone for a long time and the day
is finally here so here we go so for
those of you that didn't see the first
round of pop sockets they go like this
onto your phone you can pop them out you
can put them in your hand if you have a
bigger phone you can use two of them as
a stand you can wrap your headphones
around them there's clips that are
available on the website if you like to
use your phone in your car and mount it
it just mounts right like that and it
sticks on your dash it's really helpful
I use mine every day
I'm so sorry old Carmen and marbles like
I feel bad because you can't get these
anymore just taking them off look at
that this is four months old and this
boy does not want to come off so as much
as I adore these I think I'm going for
tie-dye Carmen and marbles and Kermit's
awkward school picture so this is how
you do it this way old pop sockets where
you can stick them on your phone or I
have mine on my case
it is on tie-dye Kermit and marbles is
on me so if you're looking to buy anyone
some gifts this holiday season you can
buy them individually or you can buy
them in a set of all four of them
they're all available until January 15th
and they are limited edition so when
they're gone on January 15th they are
gone forever so if you would like your
very own Kermit and there's awkward
skull picture and some boys on the beach
and their tie-dye and the sunglasses
examine them so I hope you love them we
worked hard on them and I'm so pleased
that you guys love the last round
everyone always asked me what they are
so if you didn't know now you do know
that they're called pop sockets they're
so amazing and I will never go back I
literally can't hold my phone without
them and not only that but you can get
really cool red Kermit and marble stones
so I'm gonna put all the links in the
description and I hope that you love
them the goal
