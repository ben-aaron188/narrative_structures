ever since I made the video asking you
guys to roast my dogs someone in there
said something like a hamster might be
smarter than marbles I said I think a
hamster is smarter than marbles and then
we got add and people have been
requesting that I see who's smarter
marbles or hamster I don't really know
how to measure who's smarter so we came
up with like some tasks that I think
that they can do in an epic Chihuahua
versus hamster face-off
because we all know virals is really not
right at all
I'll come here I will come so these are
going to be like super exciting because
there's not much to do with a chihuahua
or a mr. right they just kind of exist
the first thing I came up with was do
they respond to their name which we know
marbles does muscle bubble
all right Marvel you get a point for
that yay goodness
just like what did i do - let's see if
ad response to his mean I think we all
know the answer but ad ad ad ad ad ad ad
ad it's me your mom had some really
knows he doesn't even really know what I
am or that I'm here but so it just
Marvel's two years to learn how to sit
and he will still not sit on hard
surfaces he will only sit on soft
surfaces but we'll try anyways I've a
pretty good feeling that ad will not but
I also have a feeling good marbles will
not upset
okay that was cute but sit I'll set
mocha me this way by facing away from me
mobile clear now let's try it on the
carpet I will sit Oh goodbye what's that
you don't want to cheat here you when we
put in the guns you well a good boy
now let's see if ad will sit for us sit
sit
ad sit sit sit ad sit
you've just different they're marbles
and that like marbles won't sit but
he'll just stare at you add won't sit
he'll just run around so I'm not sure
like which is better or worse
that's it so the last time we did this
with marbles it was we put a towel on
his head see how long it was taking to
get out of it this time I think we're
going to put him under a blanket and see
how long he takes to get out of the
blanket ad can do that too we can't put
a towel around that so um well ruffle
come here welcome Ian uh no how about
you learn what about we're doing a spin
here bud
wobble come on rubble come eivol come
whoa come oh come on look what you come
on buddy
how much time was that minute 39 Marmol
there's not a good bud
well now I know why people say he's bad
like look at him he doesn't do anything
now we're going to see how long it takes
to add to get out from underneath the
blanket this is a thick blanket - it's
gonna be a challenge for you go it now
oh he's over here these are in seven
seconds you such a clever little guy he
may not know his name where he is what I
yeah he can at least survive so the next
task we came up with was Clearing House
it takes them to find a treat hidden on
the couch and I hidden minions and put
it somewhere and you can smell it
hopefully we'll open Oh Oh No we don't
have like all day for you to find it but
mumble your retreat
he's burying it Julian
no the answer is he won't go and look
for it you have to hand feed it to him
so that he can deny it I got a dog
probably not getting a point for that
sorry bud all right yep you gonna start
the timer okay for add safety we're
going to breathe well reset him not to
get so hot are we add only has to do is
beat two minutes so timer's still going
I'm going to move the oats closer to the
wall because he likes going near the
wall what's the time oh you did it we
put him in his in his cheeks
where are you gone I was like how to eat
him so fast good boy you did it so I get
two points for that because he'd beat
marble or at least had any interest in
food that was on the couch at all all
right so that we can measure this right
this second but our next level of
intelligence is can they be potty
trained and Marvel is getting an F this
looks like it's from this morning marble
GP on the floor marbles is almost 9
years old and still just sometimes
doesn't really know where the bathroom
is look at him he's so upset Pavel I
didn't mean to embarrass you bud we're
just we're doing a test ok and ad gets a
point because he is litter trained okay
let's keep a key in his litter box
and yu-san you see that yours is like
the whole backyard and you can't figure
it out he's a humor ad get deployed so
we built marbles this very elaborate
obstacle course for him to get through
in order to get a treat you're gonna
have to go through here you understand
like dog agility training come on
all you have to do is just crawl through
system mumble need to go under the
obstacle course Kofi if it's in my hand
he thinks that it's mine and he doesn't
want to take it from me I'm so proud of
you for putting your head in the
obstacle course oh oh okay oh no I was
the kind of dog to just starve to death
it's just pillows oh well he needed a
push to get through there but he did it
I'm not sure that that's where the whole
point though half a point
wait did you eat it bud huh all right he
forgot to eat in surprise time for you
to do this anymore Mary what are you
looking at ad responded we're gonna have
ad do the obstacle course now for a
little piece of spinach we'll see if he
does it ready oh my god I wish I was
that these structures ad sir you get a
point to supervisor that's how you're
supposed to be but he has a will to live
but then again I mean marvels isn't
really alive so so the next one that we
came up with is eating out of a dish
which may seem like second nature to a
dog but to marvel is very difficult have
all this food in there people see
Julian's vlogs and you're like why do
you see marble on the ground this is why
we feed marble on the ground because he
will starve himself to death if we don't
like we don't even have to wait here we
know he's not going to eat out there
really this is just like a cautionary
tale if you'd like to get it to WA you
have like 20 years of this to a fortune
in here this is a prison trapped in his
own prison you don't get any points no
you do not all right let's see it's ad
will eat out of a dish like a
similar-sized dish - this is by far ads
most gifted talent like marbles would
never I mean not only will add eat out
of his dish but he will drink water and
eat food from anywhere
our next test of intelligence is going
to be are they good outside they're
animals
that's like the real natural habitat
let's see so nice uh so quiet and
peaceful you want to come up here
so now let's see how ad does outside Wow
wonderful
amazing such a good little hamster
outside relax
nice easy biting grass not barking at
all not aggressive I'd definitely get
the point for this although I'm not sure
that this proves intelligence I think
it's something whether or not they'll
pose for a picture marble marble you
wanna beautiful easy she's so good at
posing for pictures 10 out of 10 marble
why are you crying
how about you let's see how add poses
for a picture I mean we already know
this but it is very difficult to get a
picture of that and add hi Edie just
look at the camera this this is like the
status quo of trying to take a picture
of that
sorry ad but I think I will beat you in
that department you guys all get a zero
for this every single one of you ad you
included
you can't even live with other hamsters
about fighting them to that so our next
test of intelligence is going to be will
they walk on a leash which we know
marbles will do good boy so smart go
wherever mommy goes because let's hear
only mater survive now I couldn't find a
hamster leash available I wonder why but
I fastened blend out of elastic and look
at that and you're going to pay boy
you're walking on a leash I'm a little
nervous
it looks a little more dramatic than it
is there's a slipknot in there for
safety
not exactly relaxing but he's walking on
a leash at Oh God oh hell yeah yeah
what's up guys I'm Jenna I'm 30 I like
to walk my hamster a leash that I mean
she's going for it oh he's going Wow at
heel Adsit wow what a good boy are you
having a good time
oh my goodness in case you ever feel
like recreating this up and you go oh my
god and I guess what I was going to say
in case you feel like recreating this
just so the final scores are add has
seven boys in marble
as about five or six depending whether
or not you consider being manipulative
where the other point I mean yeah these
are great tests of intelligence but like
the joke was that marbles is dumber than
a hamster balls is really dumb perfect
that means you love and you're not even
alive I guess the moral of this video is
that if you'd like a chihuahua or get a
hamster you know it's up to you but
there basically is the same pet one
lives in a cage and like doesn't really
need anything and lives outside of the
cage needs a lot and is a lot so yeah I
mean I know this was like the most
exciting thing in the world but there's
not a lot that you can do with a rodent
and a glorified rodent the results are
final add is officially smarter than
Marvel's there's no other way around it
you know what the nice thing about add
is that he just wants to live
whereas marbles it's like it's a daily
task 266 for self alive this is what you
guys wanted so I hope that you're happy
marbles is officially dumber than
hamster make sure you subscribe to my
channel I put out new videos every
Wednesday / Thursday move away from me
