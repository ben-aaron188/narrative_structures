it's sad but it happened I took my stage
I decided just yesterday that they were
hanging on by their last leg and I sort
of just ripped them out how many weeks
was that they were in there for like
five or six weeks right that's like a
full lifetime for a set of extensions so
my extensions I feel like just screamed
elegance and beauty especially when you
could see they definitely screamed
especially you can see the tie-dye blond
brute in the back and overall my
experience and say was pretty good
because we had a cat here last week it
didn't really update anyone on my facial
hair
it really doesn't grow back like spiky
like I can feel it but if you were to
feel it I don't think you'd be able to
tell that I shaved but I feel like
shaving your face is something like if
you have a nice night out or like time
when you'd like your face to look
flawless
I'm shaving every time from here on out
every week for the most part I asked to
my facebook what you guys want to see
for me and this is actually a suggestion
from someone so for those of you that
are like you never do it suggestions yes
I do it I'm doing them right now if
you'd like to complain go complain to
her I actually used to have a hair up
when I was like 11 or 12 my mom let me
get one it sort of just like stays in
your hair and you get a little dreadlock
here at the top of your head and
sometimes she has to just cut the whole
thing off depending how long you leave
it in there it's based yeah it's
basically a friendship bracelet on your
hair listen okay
if you see a 31 year old lady with the
friendship bracelet in her hair the
collar gaps now when I was a kid this
like floss was so easy to find we had to
go to two stores and these are the only
colors that they had so it's gonna be
like a nice winter themed hair wrap you
don't have to say cut so I've seen some
videos on youtube like laurdiy that
people make them on a hair extension
which I've literally never thought of
but I'm not gonna do that okay I'm just
gonna go right into my head I think I'm
gonna put mine like under here but like
shouts out to all my brave 12 with 13
year olds that are doing this like right
here y'all are much bolder than me and
like do you think but I'm I still have
to function as the thirty year old lady
in society I think I'm gonna put it down
T what if I do like a huge thick one
what if I just braided my entire right
side of my hair I was watching some
young girls tutorial thank God for her
you braid it first
it's money and they good get you a man
that pumps you up
I remember having a hair wrap in the
summer it's like a very summer thing
what camps did you go to when you're a
kid I went to some softball camps but I
also went to like an art camp
honestly you want to know what's
exhausting looking at art cutting I've
never seen anyone in their 30s with a
hair at rules are made to be broken
sister can we have a Viking funeral for
my hair extensions yeah we like the boat
on fire so they can go to heaven someone
literally took years to grow those out
of their own head and I threw them into
my garbage it's fucked up where are you
going why are you leaving welcome back
to my midlife crisis tutorial I am 31
years old I have a pet hamster a
basketball game tomorrow and a tiny
braids in my hair that I'm going to turn
into a friendship bracelet do you know
any girls who like how to hear up yeah
yeah really
I've seen it is not a softball player
they do not know do not know pink orange
yellow are you calling me a preteen
raise your textbook I did it like three
times probably the length of my hair you
sort of just fucking tie it in your hair
after this I'm thinking about going to
Claire's and piercing my ears it's
already tangled and that's why you leave
extra all right ladies okay tell me
where the men are what color should I
start with
oh this is hard to do on you
so what if I do this I hold this string
close up here like this while they do it
so it doesn't tangle after I'm finished
let's go out to a really nice dinner and
I'll put all my hair up except I don't
know how much time this takes when I was
younger I membrane taking a while do you
have anything to do this is the lazy way
this is like literally just wrapping
around from what I remember when you
take a shower this thing stays wet for
fucking days and like basically tie a
knot no going back now on a scale of 1
to snack listen my tutorial you leave
the orange one out you put it somewhere
safe we have letterman jackets in
seventh grade you didn't get varsity 7th
grade my first kiss yeah how was it
Oh braces everything I had braces for 4
years
do you know how hard it is to play the
clarinet with braces
tell us about your first kiss while I
wrapped my hair we went to the back yard
we were sitting on a bench so what is a
bench in there bad like it's your turn
so we went to the side of the house and
and I grabbed her shoulders then and
then we just leaned in and did it and I
think I went the room I think I went the
wrong way at first because then we had
like a knowing two airplanes are trying
to back I thought that you could pick
like you know when you snowboard it's
either goofy or regular I thought I
couldn't choose at the time and then
it's just a mouthful of metal for like
30 seconds and then that was it that was
my evening do you have braces no but I
did for 30 seconds and I was like what
the fuck is the big deal this sucked
like I hate it it was much older she to
grades oh damn you didn't know the girl
while I was 12 in 98 how old are you now
oh shit what were you doing in the 90s
I was learning how to walk at diapers
some of the 90s I went to a few magic
shows all magic shows after dinner at
the same magic at that restaurant Johnny
Ace Palmer my guy blowing our goddamn
minds every Sunday night for a very very
steep price at Earth Wind & Flowers
forgot it so now that I have completed
my white wrap watch this shit fucking

an expression of myself what is the
exact same personality that I have a
basketball game tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow and tomorrow I really got
my first kiss and like kindergarten she
can't make his French style in seventh
grade he was my first boyfriend too his
name was Spencer and then when I wanted
to stop dating him I gave his friend a
note that said I want to bring myself an
exquisite fucking hair up

title of this video pink white yellow

I fucked it up or else I'm gonna get
very upset I feel like if I had a living
grandmother this is something I would
love to just put in her hair can I go
one in your grandma's hair yes right
yeah like I feel like this is a thing
that like 12 year olds and grandmas
would be like you know that you're
probably too old to have a hair up if
while you're doing it your shoulder just
fucking kills the whole time I saw a
thing that like does this for you like
spins around your hair and gives you an
automatic one also we're at Michael's we
saw a like a digital bracelet maker like
how lazy are you it showed a little girl
like typing on the screen and typing in
like BFF and then it weaves it for you
like a second it's so dumb imagine
getting a BFF crease line or cholera
book collar so I know that everything
that I do to myself people are like why
would you do that that's so dumb oh my
god but like I have yet to do something
that I like really didn't enjoy it like

homestretch

fucking elegant is that when I was
younger and I had a hair up there was
like a clay bead at the bottom with a
moon and a star oh my god it was
beautiful I got something a little more
appropriate oh yeah I'm gonna tie my
literal hair into a knot at the bottom
oh we gonna need another knot

thought I was done here though you would
be incorrect I want a full 90s hairdo
bitch Jesus is coming with my hair too
did you ever read the Bible it's a very
long book
it's very Madonna she was my favorite
singer in the 90s and then I graduated
to Sarah McLachlan I wanted to go to the
Lilith Fair more than anything in the
world and we're done
first of all this is a deadly fucking
weapon laughing at me does the order of
the Ottomans truly show that ball really
is over everything yeah all of life I
may cut the cross off if it starts
hurting people or breaking things but
honestly it's really pretty isn't it
it's pretty cool you like it inspire you
for your own beautiful nineties elegant
amazing beautiful hair that this is very
dangerous it's not funny it's very
serious it's a serious hair accessory I
just spent like three or four hours
doing that yeah
so up here we have the thickest part in
the part that hurts my ears and hair the
most and we have various colors wrapping
around each other it's very elegant down
here is where all of my split ends start
poking out and showing themselves and
down here is where I tied my hair into a
knot so I could put a basketball on top
of it if you saw me in the grocery store
and had all my hair up except for that
like oh dude that right there it's a
woman that knows what she wants in life
no yeah I'm excited to add this thumb to
my repertoire things that trend is

there but I do want to touch it I don't
pull it

for my exquisite elegant nineties hair
wrap tutorial as you can tell it is very
easy and professional if you're a thirty
year old lady just like me this will
take you from a zero to a real beautiful
woman in no time about four hours
hostage like a scary person and because
I didn't I too many knots I should be
able to just drive like slip most of it
out which is exciting because I think
when I was younger I just cut it off at
the root because it was gross when I'm
done with this should we cut it and keep
it no all right make sure you subscribe
