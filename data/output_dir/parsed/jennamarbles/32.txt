that wasn't it out you know so Julian I
made two videos where he taught me how
to do Jitsu I don't know how much I
learned what are you doing I said in
that second you learn anything that's
how much you learned yeah I didn't I
wasn't having fun I learned how to die I
said in that video that someday I would
teach Julian how to throw a softball
because I was a picture in college but
like not a good one like you're going to
get some real bTW when you said you were
good
no I didn't like it I wasn't even like a
jar drummer guy yeah maybe you're a cop
I could borrow one prayer for one of
Julian's I'm like is one perfect we're
going to teach Julian how to pitch a
softball show me what you think it is oh
it's a mess it's work exactly I was done
your arm is so been look at that okay
it's fierce that's intimidating look at
me right now and tell me you're not in
today no let me a nod I don't want to
face that are you going straight if you
could just like flex right here alright
are you ready we're going to warm up a
little bit bit I'm your coach real coach
but like all of the best coaches that
I've ever had I find the best most
effective way to coach yu's to just
verbally abused you while we do this get
off your fucking head you damn idiot why
stretch out your arm for a second but
extreme this hearses it's book for her
yeah alright so some of these are your
wrists some of these do you really
actually do it you can this is nice
fitting in my forearm
yeah exactly give me some good arm
circles straighten your arm straighten
your arm
straighten it it's true straighten it
it's literally the straightest mom has
ever been in my life
Wow
you just want to warm up your wrists
right now so you're going to throw it
from here keep your arm straight just
your wrist cock back and you do that
about a hundred times 100 or just just
100 times it's gonna get dark oh that's
good fat boy how you you can go up to 3
o'clock or whatever this is good hundred
of those this is fun we're having fun
are you going to talk shit about how
this is slower than how you throw it I'm
gonna pitch to you now so you can see
what we're going to go from here then
we're going to go from here and then
we're going to do full circles okay my
guys are gonna back up okay so from
halfway oh my god are you trying to kill
me oh okay yes sure go ahead
it's scary right don't do that
oh my god thank you I don't hey that's
good that you're doing better than I
thought you'd do well my standard was
already pretty low I think okay great
Junior there you go I better no it's too
hot I get away from here I get more
momentum yeah I know we got to warm up
your arms make sure you follow along
because I'm not gonna explain sorry I'm
kidding
whoa that damn bullet shoes my body it
doesn't feel like it used to
it's not me pitching it's you pitch
you're good you should play sometime
how do you all right before you start
off you have to do your progression no
no shell Sam this is the worst catcher's
mask in the world actually dare you I
work so hard to attain this this is true
wear a shell and then you put it on top
where it's a shell it's or you're gonna
get turtle with no shell what is this
this seems more dangerous you were a
shell of the helmet and then a map
we're not playing an actual game is no
bat so you don't need to actually shut
weddy hat off and they say yo ready you
can take a step - OH
slap OH kill him take a step and then
when you're done you've got to close
your hips so you're facing forward Oh
Hayley why are you laughing oh it's
really good technique Pig no Perry babe
it's all just in your wrist snap so snap
it right at the place where you're
practicing now I'm trying to do it all
with my wrist yeah you're supposed to
I'm sorry
this feels a lot like revenge and I'm
feeling pretty happy about it
good concentration no step don't let go
your does it provides momentum okay why
don't you go back up to go up to 12
o'clock are you sure I'm sure you want
to get down with the mask with a stupid
fucking death on it about my mouth it's
a it's literally the best map in the
world it's not safe
you're not wearing the whole match you
need a show get a show all right what's
the sign
don't do that with your hand oh shit oh
they probably do the full thing because
they don't know where it's going to go I
completely forgot I brought something to
help you here you go oh wow yeah
I'm a softball player mom don't break it
it's vintage and authentic presents it
on my head a little bit
it actually doesn't fit I'm a softball
player I want to be any size Sam you're
just opening up right now you look like
a mess I'm afraid to throw it past you
try not be afraid no give me a full
motion no back up a little bit for
fuck's sake forgot yeah but we're going
to open and close your hip you guys
that's throw it hard what I can't get
any juice on it you gotta snap your
wrist oh I didn't do a wrist get your
arm moving real fast and snap your wrist
don't complain Julian's on the squad you
might do that this is sliding down my
face you got to be wearing the hat
something show your where the happier
wear this shirt you love I killed my
girlfriend I almost died see that's
better right no this just feels like
more things on my face you up not before
coming here kid I need better coaching
all right now you're gonna choose our
Julie listen huh okay you're doing a lot
of more all right I'm going to give in
to your weird sick fans in the front I'm
your coach you gonna listen to me let me
show you what you look like and then you
tell me what you think is wrong your arm
is bent and and I'm not doing weird shit
but that's how you got to do it no I'm
not this is my athletic stance I'm not
athletic like this I need to be here
everything is tall and up so okay let me
try again Spencer I care for that so far
away from my caramel throw it into the
street
at all
that's much better really that was
better yes that's a joke no it's not
good okay and then they kind of line on
my hand now the next thing you can work
on doing is pushing off your back foot
and taking along but all you're doing is
teaching me feet I have no momentum I
mean I have no accuracy
that'll come push off your so I take a
big stride like almost a job a big
stride as a mediocre stride oh that's
what I'm talking about
ha ha ha Plus see this is good form
you're open to the side coach I'm not on
big long or anything and now how you
didn't finish it
let's try caramell ok if you don't kill
them and hit them with the ball yes
close your hips ass accurate yeah hell
yeah
ok does I feel better goes all right now
pitch to me like that
desire to murder my life oh yeah yeah
how does it feel how's your arms all
good everything hurts but it's good bad
it looks painful
you look like you're in genuine pain
feet like hell you're doing awesome oh
yeah here is a strike if I've ever seen
a fucking easy dude I mean that's high 4
dB
I'm trying to get momentum on it he's
just causing the closer I'm in heat baby
already hit is it to cut high you know a
statistical can walk along this red
I was betting all right that's a little
better guy next one you throw stays here
give me a real good scream when you let
it go okay three all good pictures but I
just screamed and let it up like it read
like like tennis react in college when
we would play a picture that would
scream we would yell back as we better
be like oh here we go
we made for some very passive-aggressive
there's my view there's like kids over
there yeah but it's not a gun on her
your hand no I'm just not going to throw
my body in front you block it with your
chest
no no I'm here to half-ass catchman
half-ass guys only give me good screen
be tall be blond be beautiful right so
super straight right in the perfect
rifle Julia yeah you got good what can I
say I wear a lot of visors right oh shit
hi maybe hang up drink up oh shit here
we go Phoebe bye oh it looks just like
your fastball dude you didn't even know
that was tight it look all right what
else yeah curveball curveball see it
right no one I died out are you laughing
at how hard they swing and miss on Maui
and knuckleball cherish I mean that's a
loss what I think that was my best one
here nobody hitting it
alright that's all here I can do this
what oh okay I'm gonna let this one go
blend it all out truly and who are you
who are you doing
straight black I really thought that was
going to be good why was it that one
good I thought that was going to be the
best one you're just letting go of the
ball too late so instead of like letting
go right at the hip you're letting go
like over here it's not to be letting go
right here every time right here oh my
gosh
I mean you're better off having a go
into the ground then go off into the
stands and kill a kid
well there's pros and cons to each I
suppose that's when you're ready for the
best one yet tips cap m'lady
oh shit she sassy is fucked make sure
you scream though right oh yeah that one
move do you feel confident I feel more
confident in softball you did it energy
to know but you played baseball's not
fair it's really different like one does
not simply just take up a combat sport
okay good job
wait tell me good job no you called me a
non-athlete I didn't call your knowledge
I couldn't move my legs
I said you were moving like a knife but
I could pull you under the table Oh
respect me now hit the shop
I thought you know oh are you coming
over
thanks for teaching me no throw a
softball I still really like that I get
it I think I understand like be tall and
I know I'm a wordsmith try to keep up
like that
I just need to work on the stride and
the release point and my hips and my
feet and my hands and my motion and my
follow-through and my start that's it
and then I'll be going sweaty right now
make sure you wake up at like 5:00 in
the morning and do that and then play a
game later in the afternoon open in the
morning and then the games yeah you know
but one of us finished our college
career my parts getting cut I got hurt
you dick hurts my pussy like mine you
little pussy ah what Julian isn't
overhead oh yeah there is no such
Thursday if you don't fucking let you
down I'm pretty I'm gonna do it
hopefully
Oh
