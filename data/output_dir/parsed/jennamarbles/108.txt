my friends so I recently realized that
the majority of people that watch my
videos are no longer mostly teenage
girls they're mostly full-blown adult
E's like myself and that just makes me
infinitely happy because I feel like you
understand me that also means that we've
grown together which I really appreciate
and just gives me all kinds of warm
Happy's on the inside today I would like
to talk about some more adult things
which makes me happy because I made one
in the past called things I get excited
about as an adult and whenever I make
videos about my actual life my life
tends to get ten times better from it
it's like I put it out there and I hold
myself accountable for it I really
haven't played all their skills for
example since I made that thing and
they're not like huge adult tasks it's
not like paying my taxes or rent or
things like that they're like small
little things that perpetuate me being a
child that I assumed I would grow out of
but somehow never did so I'm gonna go
first I'm gonna put it all out there and
hopefully we can get better together so
here's some things that I'm bad at as an
adult the first thing that I'm bad at is
talking to people on the phone I've even
had jobs in the past where you have to
call complete strangers for a lot of
your day I as an adult just do not want
to talk to anyone on the phone that I
don't know family sure but ordering a
pizza there's a place that I like to
order pizza from and they have an app
but it doesn't really work that way and
I realized sometimes that I'm gonna have
to call to order my pizza and I can't
really upset about it I have to give
myself a little pep talk about it like
it's okay janet's all right it's just a
person can do this
I'll get my order already and I'll call
them really high huh this is a person
pizza or I will try and pawn it off to
Julianne first I'd be like Julian why
don't you uh won't you call and order
that thing or something I'll go wrong
and you'll be like why don't you just
call I'm gonna talk to my person I don't
know where this foam fear came from I
don't know when I was supposed to get
over it but I never really did I'm
scared of talking to people on the phone
I'm just bad at doing it I'm also
terrible at having decor or carrying
about things in my house for example I
rent this place and there's a lot of
windows in here so that means I would
have to get a lot of curtains so you
know what I did I bought a bunch of
paper curtains what am I going to do
spend all my money on curtains no
there's my paper curtain is it a dolt
absolutely not it looks like a frat
house
it really doesn't bother me to just look
at paper curtains I'm not a very good
adult fake fake adult maybe I'm too
smart adult you can draw on them I'm bad
at eating at a table growing up we
always ate meals at a table together
with everybody and what I think of
adults I think of them sitting at their
tables with their sophisticated
Pinterest meals and shit whenever I eat
it's on the couch and I'm usually
watching something I don't use tables
they like I'm gonna have kids someday
and they're gonna grow up really fucked
up there'd be like mom what's that like
it's a table what's it for not breeding
for craps I'm really bad at responding
to text messages I see someone text me I
click on it I open it I read it and I
tell myself I'm gonna get back to them
in a couple of minutes and then it gets
lost forever and I just never do yes I
realize it's not very adult of me to not
get back to people in a timely manner
but I'm gonna do a very adult thing
right now just deflect blame there
should be a mark as unread option like
in your email so I mean it's technically
the people's fault that made text
messages what if I need to think about
it what if I can't answer it right away
therefore this is only half of my fault
the other half of Steve's fault Dorothy
CFRP I'm really bad at getting the oil
changed in my car I don't need a lecture
on why it's bad to let it go and not do
it I know it's bad I'm just really bad
at doing it in fact the last two times
that the oil was changed in my car once
was Julianne and once was my mom and
they did it because whenever you sit in
my car you get like an annoying
notification that says change me it
annoyed them so much that they did
something nice for me two times I feel
like it should have a severity warning
on it like time to change your oil
please change your oil we're gonna
fucking die if you don't change the soil
even then I'd probably still see how far
I could go because I like to live life
on the edge I'm gonna be really honest
with you right now and say that I am bad
at recycling I don't always rinse
everything out I don't always separate
like cans and paper sometimes I just
throw it all in there and hope for the
best say a prayer for the environment
one time Julian told me that our
recycling bin was full so he threw some
of it into the trash and if you could
please be gentle with me because I have
a lot of shame and guilt attached to
that I'm not that good at recycling you
need work on it I'm really bad at
knowing that something is too hot and
still touching it and putting it in my
mouth I feel like you learned this so
quickly as a kid and you unlearn it so
slowly
as an adult I'll make a bagel in the
toaster oven and I will put my hand in
there to get it out knowing full well
that it's gonna burn me but I just hope
maybe this time it's not gonna burn as
bad or when I'm eating something with
visible levels of steam being like I can
handle it's no big deal
no hint you know better than this I mean
that's just common sense
maybe I'm just bad at common sense when
it comes to food because I'm too hungry
I was told that I was gonna need this
and that I better pay attention and try
my best when I was in school but you
know what I literally never use cursive
so I guess I'm a bad adult I'm really
bad at listening to voicemails I don't
know why because I don't like them
they're unnecessary and also on my phone
I haven't even set up my voicemail box
so you can't even leave me a message and
I don't know the password even if I
wanted to set it up because I don't care
about them so I wanna be like hey I left
you a message
yeah I didn't listen to it what was it I
will still make my phone giving me a
pop-up box that says please type in your
password to set up your voicemail every
other day then set up my voicemail I'm a
bad adult because you can't really get a
hold of me you can't leave me a message
you send me a text message I'm gonna
open it and fuckin forget about it I'm
terrible at remembering birthdays dates
for some reason just don't go into my
brain right this is why I can't study
history it's terrible as the worst
subject and Facebook helped me for like
a year it would be like it's so and so's
birthday now I don't really use Facebook
so it's back to fucking happy belated
birthday for me and a lot of that stems
from the fact that I don't really ever
know what the date is I know it's a
Wednesday what's the date I don't know
it's a day I'm terrible at answering the
door I will let cower in the back of my
house and let crunch down in a little
ball and hope they can't see me through
the door so I don't have to go and
answer it even if they have a package
I'm sitting back there like crossing my
fingers hoping that they'll just leave
it cuz I do not want to open the door i
watch a lot of Dateline ok that could be
a murderer here to kill me for no reason
but like still it happens I mean that's
something adults do right answer their
door when someone fucking knocks on nope
not me you're gonna have to leave a note
to stand on the top of the stairs
nobody's home I'm really bad at having
adult dishes the other night me and some
friends were making cocktails and I
wanted to put them all in glasses that
were the same does that be a festive
adult thing to do right well I literally
do not have even more than two glasses
or cups that are the same thing they're
all just like random with plastic
tumblers and cups of ramen
dollar store like nothing matches you
know when you go to someone's house and
you open their cabinet and everything is
like the same yeah I don't have that
looks like a mess and then when I give
my friend their drink it's like in a
fucking sippy cup I got nothing not even
two of them matched not even two and
it's not just cups this is how bad it is
the majority of the plates and my
cupboard that I eat off of every single
day weren't even mine to begin with my
old roommate left them in the apartment
when she moved out that was in 2008 eat
off of them every day still can't get
some new plates I'm really bad at
opening my mail I had the foresight to
buy a little basket to put my mail into
and then I never opened it I just put
more mail on my mail and then when the
basket gets full I go through it and
realize that I missed a lot of shit
about it having any sort of time frame
of how old I am for example I live in a
really big city where most people are
very focused on their careers all the
time so it's easy to get wrapped up in
all of that and then I'll talk to old
friends and they'll be like I had a baby
and now it's a full-blown person and I'm
like you have a person already oh where
is the time gone
they don't even hold hands with their
little person anymore their person is
like a person I'm a really bad adults
because I for some reason I'm still kind
of scared of being alone in the house
and like in the dark you know if you go
upstairs you go to bed and realize that
you forgot something you have to go
downstairs you know how I do it by
sprinting it's scary I don't have an
attic or a basement but if I did I would
sprint in them I'm really bad at getting
rid of things I just like them it's
sometimes they're not even broken
they're like what's wrong with it let's
keep it I feel like that comes from our
parents when they just teach you like oh
it's still good everything was still
good we got to keep everything so now I
do keep everything shouldn't just get
rid of things because they're broken or
worn down no like my glasses I was
reading a book about decluttering your
life and that's something that helps
people to get rid of their belongings is
to thank them before you get rid of them
so I did this recently with my hair
dryer because I got a new hair dryer for
the first time in like a decade I said
goodbye to my old hair dryer I said
thank you for blowing my hair out for so
many years and then around that like
five-year point I dropped you and the
back of you fell off and a dead
cockroach fell out and you know what I
did I threw the cockroach away I put
your backpack on and I used you for
another five years you were still good
you were good friend I loved you I
appreciated you and then I finally threw
him the garbage so I'm gonna give myself
a pound
for that yeah no more cockroach
hairdryer but it still worked why would
I get rid of it you see adults that just
have these like clean beautiful homes
with non paper curtains full of like
almost no possessions other than fancy
beautiful little things so you don't
even know what they do that's what I
feel like an adult is like not me I'm
really bad at cleaning things after I
use them like my bathtub I did a coffee
scrub in my bathtub the other day and
did I rinse it out after enough just
left it in there j-just run some water
on there that's really lazy yeah but in
theory it's gonna get clean next time I
take a bath that's what a bath is for it
gets clean if it can clean me it can
clean itself right that okay that is
pure laziness and I would like to end
this video by telling you something that
I'm good at as an adult which is always
being happy and laughing through some
rough times my family this week had kind
of rough time and I was talking with
them and they're just so inspiring
because they were seeing the humor and
things and trying to laugh and trying to
stay happy and I wanted to tell you that
I get comments often people being like
hey I was having a bad day or like I've
been going through some tough shit and
your video made me laugh and I
appreciated it and I've always really
liked those comments I appreciate that
you say that means a lot to me but this
week was the first time that I went on
the Internet and I felt like I really
needed something to just make me laugh
to get me through the day I just wanted
to say thank you to those of you that
put funny things on the internet the
tweet funny things and me nice things in
me you're there
for me and it was the first time that I
really felt like now I know what this
feels like now I know what it's like to
go and seek some happy support from the
internet and it was really really good
everything's fine I'm fine
my family's fine everyone's fine don't
worry but I just wanted to thank you for
helping me get through kind of a tough
week this week and I appreciate it a lot
so yeah those are some things that I'm
bad at as an adult and one thing that
I'm good at as an adult I just wanted to
put them out there so I can hold myself
accountable and you know maybe make you
feel better in case you're a far
superior adult than me which isn't very
hard to do you you good adult thing the
rest of us mediocre adulting at least
you're trying make sure you subscribe to
my channel I put out new videos every
Wednesday / Thursday and if you ever
want more I have a vlog channel also the
podcasts that we've put up every single
Monday
and we twitch stream at least every
Monday night on our twitch channel if
you're ever looking for me not on
Wednesday so there's always those I'm
gonna go buy fucking stack of plates
right now because I'm sick of eating off
of plates that were never mine and you
know what might go fucking crazy get
like four cups that I'll match each
other next time I make a cocktail if
there's fifth person there and I'd be
like you're fucked rest of us are living
I'll see you guys next week bye
