don't start sentences and not finish
that sentence you said well welcome back
to Jenny's righteous salon it's really
not ratchet this is a professional sauce
I got I can't believe I got an
appointment I thought this place was
closed down it looks closed down the
windows are boarded up why'd you let him
go
no prisoner now there's no escape did
you just say ex cases escape tonight
it's escaped too late to say the word
escape they were an excuse no we're
break it up I can't escape I know is
this a picture or a pitcher pitcher I'm
saying here are my buttons push them and
I'm sitting here like I like buttons
Julian used to get Brazilian blots he's
got him what like three of them and then
when you bleeped you to be really dry
and the texture was like kind of
unmanageable especially when you sweat
so he actually was gonna go into his
hairdresser and get a Brazilian Blowout
tomorrow and I was like wait whoa whoa
whoa whoa I'm pretty sure we can offer
that and Jenny's ratchets a lot if you'd
like to do it today I would like to do
it today obviously your hair is not like
the curliest in the world this isn't
gonna be like an astonishing
before-and-after but I'm excited because
I've never
I burned my hair but I've never gone
back with and like straight into hair
this is the one we're using this is
technologically advanced it's for
virgins
no no virgin hair
virgins shampoo your hair get wet
somewhere with you I'm not gonna wash
your hair it's not in my services this
is the worst salon
I have to go shower myself at the salon
and wash my hair yeah you tell the
client to go into the back and wash
their hair and I'm just like literally
are you allergic to burn I don't know
lies that's my daughter my allergic to
perm how do you find that with like a
skin test
go wash your hair I'm popping off the
bottoms so I'm gonna finish reading
these directions while it Julien
bottomless Li washes his hair and then
we'll get this started
are you excited yeah some will say it's
a success story some will say it's a
lifestyle piece you know it's um it's
poison you don't stop look can you ever
just sit still and doing your hair back
I'm not gonna tell you to stop again
sure this is like the straightening it's
a two-step process
what's the second step this is okay if
you get on my scalp it's at a quarter
inch what time were you born remember
what did the lion say when he was about
to have his photography equipment store
okay he said hey that's my camera you
just call my hair you know one time I
put a whole goop of mayonnaise in my
pocket for my hair time I don't think
you know what shapes are cuz that's
definitely a bowl if there's cereal in
it then it is immediately for cereal
it's amazing how much straighter it is
already with that mustache yeah you
looking like us Nick so what happens
right after this but I just go I go drop
the bottoms and shampoo it up keep your
bottoms on there's nothing you can do
this can delete let me keep my box on I
used to be a camp counselor and without
fail there was always one kid that would
like say I have to go to the bathroom
they pull their pants down their shirt
all the way up but you're just like
rinse hair thoroughly for seven to ten
minutes using moderate water pressure
and making sure stage one is completely
out of the hair looks really straight
and wash your hair for seven minutes
this looks like a lot straighter already
it does feel like a little dry but
that's because you didn't shampoo it in
conditioner right but you're gonna
condition it later so it's like it does
it doesn't feel like residue
burning my scalp and you have a beat on
one spot the people I can see you
mocking me in a viewfinder
oh you're like a new woman
I feel chemically it oh nice so now we
are going to meticulously as we can't
let I in this beautiful hair I'm 450 so
it melts oh my god please don't pull my
hair out of my head
he said do short ones and then do long
ones fucking doing you little hair
police we you pull over like your hair
didn't fall out it doesn't feel
chemically are you not like impressed
right now I'm actually Tai Chi
impressing myself I thought this is
gonna sort of end badly just be careful
I don't want any hair fall out cuz I got
an audition for a hair commercial mom
called knees and shoulders it's gonna
compete with head and shoulders yeah
it's not shampoo at all it's a front for
a drug cartel hey when you're done with
that can you leave it on I want to pop
my panini in there it's so straight in
the front look so funny that's how you
usually do your hair is this what your
hair looks like when your hair doesn't
know I'm sleep Julian but that mustache
this is very like Mitch from pentatonix
like I'm diggin it I need you to not be
on your phone and keep your head
straight moving it's not difficult
close your mouth can you imagine like
this that your real hair dresser you
look like like Anthony cues from Hot
Chili Peppers when you put your head up
straight it's not moving right Julian
are you ready for - no what is this this
one only stays in for like five to seven
okay one thing I do know as a
hairdresser I don't think that there's
anything more annoying than honestly
reminding somebody to just like sit up
oh this is hot it's supposed to be hot
but they feel good
fine I'm all right am I supposed to do
is a boy I agree
way easier you just comb it and it's
straight where is the curly I feel like
I said it in a specific shape and spot
you fucking kidding me
excited Julian did you shower bottomless
I actually kept my bottoms on this time
because I was cold
it was a damn girl you fucking did it
that looks so good I'm no no this is
like really good you see I was really
like nervous this looks good so smooth
and like it feels like a real treatment
like my hair when I perved it did not
fucking feel like this this feels like
smooth and nice and not like a groom you
did a really really you like it yeah
like um I never thought that this would
be you thought I was trolling you and I
said we're gonna do this yeah I never
thought this would be like so doable at
home I don't know well neither did I
because like when they started getting
popular it was like this really
expensive treatment seemed like a big
long process that was hard you know but
that's what I really wanted to try it
because like I don't know I called
y'all's fucking Bluff you fucking nailed
it dude I can't call your bluff I did
this for $26 your hair does not look or
feel damaged it feels better
it really doesn't it's that's one of the
things that I'm surprised about is how
like healthy my hair
after all that it's probably all the
model my showers I took after you know a
few watches or whatever it's definitely
gonna feel like you had a chemical
treatment on your ear but for now it
feels and looks amazing what do you
think it looks hey I wanted to like
nitpick it but it looks fantastic I feel
like if you got like a nice little
haircut it wouldn't be so like I have a
haircut tomorrow I have to tell my my
barber yeah give me a score out of ten
nine point two you got deducted point
eight or I'm coming for his men I'm
really glad that you let me do it
because I always felt like after the
perm I was like well I know that a
Brazilian Blowout it's sort of a similar
process but I bet it's easier to do it
straighter especially if you have short
hair like for me it might take a lot
longer and my hair can't handle it it
will die a plus I don't think I need one
cuz my hair's relatively straight you
don't do that well I'm really excited to
me this is like a big deal I think
bottomless showers are the reason this
turned out like it looks great almost as
good as this
nothing will look as good as but it's
like they're in that group of hairs in a
time capsule that doesn't get to get
washed it does get washed that's why
it's turning blue
cuz it's my blue hair is getting on it a
free six dollar Brazilian blow are you
fucking me on where the fuck y'all come
up this two hundred dollar price tag
like I get it y'all experience and
licenses and labor is very valuable but
$26 I'll take it we'll see how long it
holds up yeah will you ask Roth tomorrow
yes oh my god it's a $5 to a $10 tip
please I can get breakfast no son I said
don't spend it all thank you for having
me in your salon how do you feel that
your secret is fully out in the open
that you like my CDs been on the open
the moment
did this for the first time you started
telling people online Kaori I drink in
front of everyone it's not hot oh wait
oh we're so happy together this is the
stress grip yeah that's it make sure you
subscribe to our channel I put a new
piece every Wednesday slash thirsty
traveler channel with those that's my
tip you gave that to me come come come I
hope you guys like this I don't know
it's just an experiment for me but I
really wanted to see if I could do it I
think it's really helpful information
that it cost twenty six dollars and it's
really not that difficult if you have
someone help you at home that's a weird
don't say whip and I will undo I will
curl your hair previously my hair made
my day worse today my hair is so
fantastic one eight hundred know what I
just said in Morse but I definitely said
something
