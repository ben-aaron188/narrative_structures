trailer beauty gurus the beautiful
people one the beautiful people I can't
do none of this cream stuff it just sits
all in my old parts and gets even older
I'm gonna be using a perfect peach my
color is nude sister julienne don't
question me when did you make that this
definitely I don't think is full
coverage as well it's put up its face
though maybe I'll do another layer is
though but this is the ancient ruins of
like a lost civilization and the
foundation is like the earth on top of
it
physically beat your face is so
pigmented I do not have shape tape but I
do have Kat Von D lock-it concealer lock
it up
I don't have anything that's that light
puts it all the way down to around his
nose oh my old ass skin is crying is
that a brush is he putting it on is like
lower cheek too
I could just use my kid of brushes that
I accidentally lit on fire one time oh
he does okay so he puts it below like
where his contour is gonna go at this
point the only parts of your face that
are not concealed fully are the cheeks
and the forehead my too much gene is
very excited right now I can't pull off
these like really highlighted under eye
looks it's just sitting in all of my sad
people wrinkled sit chilling like this
like that looks fine but if I'm like
yeah look at that I'm kidding I only
have the Knicks line
don't know what those numbers mean okay
so you just oh no oh no it's gonna get
worse than wood
nice forehead contouring because you
know we just want a whole head to just
fucking leave this just like goes on and
it's like in his hairline like how look
it mind just makes a mess no it's like
it looks literally dirty okay see it's
moments like this where I look at the
texture of my skin and then I look at
people on the internet and I'm like
something doesn't fuck it up okay James
Charles is a teenager so I understand
but I'm like my skin has never looked
like these people's skin how tell us
your ways though like fuck look like a
half-eaten Apple on a road shape I feel
so dry just like everywhere is like okay
so he does it under the eyes in here oh
good that's like a paper mache face I'm
gonna look like one toasty raisin when
we're done with this don't get it wrong
though there's plenty of nights when you
like start your makeup with the best of
intentions and you get somewhere like
this and you're like fuck it you know
there's no turning back now
his skin still looks like skin like mine
just looks so wrinkly and sad and dry it
looks like the Sahara Desert inside of
like a fucking dusty hot pocket Oh what
is that James Charles bless you in you
young beautiful skin cuz this is my look
good look for me
James you get that money the best things
gonna pay me know to hit me up best

were sitting next to me we're just
heaven you know girl chat okay you
better be like bitch no okay this is
next
it's like charcoal II color its mix and
YX Nick isn't a person okay it's NYX mix
it's not a person's possession named
Nick all of the eyebrow elitists on the
internet are always making fun of my
eyebrows but listen will you zoom in on
this I've had a number of professionals
try and just work with this and it's not
doing a whole lot okay mathematically
it's just a worm like it has no business
here you gotta make it be something else
like a butterfly so what we're gonna do
let's just go fault James Charles Brown
2018 needs to be the year of all the
eyebrow elite is to just fucking stop it
and understand that my eyebrows are
never gonna do what yours do
okay you can't just brush them up and
fill them in brow gels okay not make a
mess when you do this look it's all over
that for it
fucking Oh sealer on the lid powder on
top that's right just like you're like
doing the other on your doughnut yeah oh
my god I have that I'm just kidding so I
have a couple of different palettes I
have a hooded palette Urban Decay
electric palette we have a lot to choose
fuck okay this red color you dips into a
red color with an m4 41 does this look
like an m4 4-1
fuck I don't know what an m4 for one
looks like what you're not gonna do is
verbally abuse me during this process
how do you spell Prague you did not it's
a little dark do I look like naturally
blessed in the eyes you did not make a
weightlifting joke in my exquisite
beautiful people tutorial that joke was
so pigmented I don't know how he gets
his shadow like pointy out here mine's
just turning more and more into a blob
sister please tell me is this too far I
don't know when to stop you know I don't
know when to stop this looks like an
infection I feel like I need to go to
the doctor like really badly today okay
that's a good like a deep burgundy
dopes as in like I said hell I'm an
artist that I invented this how was that
you nothing says Valentine's like 30 I
have a basketball game tomorrow and look
at my fucking letter bitch so he uses
this like bright pink glitter right so
this is a mix glitter brilliance that is
so elegant and beautiful Lucy stop it
though like how do you stop yourself
once I'm this far
it's like glitter time it's very
difficult to just end the glittering
beautiful I'm so proud of myself okay so
I don't have any of the like sequins but
I do have other glitter so let's just go
like glitter net that doesn't look too
hot oh I've seen myself in that I like a
very ghastly it's really pretty but I
just do not
are you okay whoa whoa it's so rare for
me to wear a makeup look without doing
the top liner and the lash like if I put
on a lash I'm like almost always putting
on the liner if you saw me what you'd
call the police I'm in the grocery store
I'm saying do you have any more almond
milk don't have that all I have is the
stomach glow gigolo kid we have come to
the last step Julian I don't have I'll
have like any Oprah lip products but I
do have this like metallic pinky pink
color okay it's gonna be okay you look
the same
okay Jace Charles now you listen here
okay you're gonna post something on the
internet with the word tutorial in it
somebody's gonna do it and you know what
today that somebody was Vee don't you
dare ever say nobody's gonna wear this
look cuz here we are look at me in my
exquisite face I'm wearing you look but
you know what we're in this together
sister that is so fun oh my god you know
sisters we're having an emergency
any spray but I do have setting sprays
cheap sister rosewater and Linden flower
sprays her sister sister what's the
solution to getting your face to stop it
you gotta find somebody my look is still
a little wet but are you ready well
Julian what do you think
I think it's creative colorful are you
ready to go out on the town where you
wanna go like Rite Aid or something very
cool it's very fun it's like this art is
facer this was really fun and I will say
like there were some steps that I missed
a little bit but this was really easy to
follow like sometimes I feel like beauty
gurus were like skip a bunch of steps
and you're like I don't know what the
fuck is happening but this was really
easy to follow and if I can do it like
anyone can do it as long as you have
access to some glitter it's really fun I
don't think I've ever worn like loose
glitter with glue it looks good it's
really fun like even if you like you
took away this part and just in the
upper part it's so pretty I had so much
fun and I know everyone thinks I'm gonna
like suck it up or whatever but like I
really tried my best and I think it
looks good Oh sister Julie another do
you like my eyebrows like this yes James
Charles style yes
oh yeah that's like that's it this was
really fun I really like this trend and
I really like seeing regular people do
like beauty guru tutorials
and I just like I've really liked
everyone's that's made it like it's just
entertaining to watch and so I hope you
guys enjoyed watching me do this because
I had so much fun recreating sister's
video this is not like a daytime casual
