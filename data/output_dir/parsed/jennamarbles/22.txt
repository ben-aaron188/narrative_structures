so I was thinking about doing this video
for a long time and then I saw that
Shane Dawson literally just posted this
and I was so like that was one of the
most enjoyable Shane videos I've ever
watched because I genuinely liked
watching Shane and Riley together
they're pretty cute in a couple days and
is my birthday and I don't know about
you but during my birthday I get
especially lazy so I was like this is
the perfect time to make Juliet go and
do all the work for me so this is going
to be my boyfriend buys new outfits now
Julian has already gone to the mall
because I had to take a shower and wash
my hair I wish I wasn't ready to do this
hold before the thing so I haven't seen
any of the clothes but he did already no
show I went shopping and let me tell you
that is not easy my style currently
is very like t-shirts like I have worn
this shirt to death I've really had it
for like two months like pants that are
comfy like leggings that's about it like
I could also always go to the gym in
whatever I'm wearing I have three looks
like I don't know how to dress myself
casually for daytime four I'm like super
done up or I'm just like very casual
there was a couple rules i abided i one
of which was you love camo and camo
colors took that into consideration see
you really bought me stuff that you
think I would like yeah so I kind of
split it up and then I started looking
for things that I think you would look
cute in but you don't necessarily shop
for yourself there's oh good there was a
couple items I got because I've always
wanted to see you wear them and you
don't well you start like please tell me
you didn't go just like buy a bunch of
bikinis and be creepy about it no I do
that normally so no today was no day I
genuinely think everything I bought
you'll enjoy wearing really with the
exception of one thing okay what's that
you'll see when you're wearing it why
I'm nervous because I feel like it's
your body you dress your body for like
how you like I'm terrified that you got
me things I'm gonna be really
uncomfortable in and with while I was
shopping today I was thinking what would
go good at a step grandparents barbecue
and that's step grants here yeah they
can make nice little summer step grandpa
we're going to a barbecue with your new
clothes so you smell that it smells like
burning cuz I just let your cause it on
fire with me okay so this jacket
immediately caught my eye because aid
the floral patterns on it are snazzy and
I think very Jenna but she also really
loves this camo green color and this
style of sort of Jean army like jacket I
don't know I think this is dumb I think
she could dress this out but also kind
of just like wear it it's down I'm
getting comfy because I think it's dope
I got you Jenna likes the army style
jackets with the knit with the camo
green and I got some floral I had the
flower stalk installed in Starr there
was a geek squad there though they could
do that so I wanted to my favorite store
is the army surplus store where so
everything's like $10 for use I like it
a lot really yeah it's really nice what
do I wear under it or with it I just put
it on but see I would didn't know I
don't know idea I didn't get you outfits
okay yes please
that's what you'd like to see me wear
yeah I think this would be mad cute on
you cuz I I really like this collar and
you like you got it in a good size cuz
you know like I'm kind of a thick bitch
and especially after we got in our car
accident I got even thicker so I'm glad
you didn't buy something super tiny for
me thank you
well getting me the right size I well
it's something I would never pick out
for myself because I would think that
this embroidery is like too cutesy
but it actually looks really nice see
that's why I like something for you
because I could get things that I know
this is a really nice check was this
expensive this is nice Julian I could
wear this with some leggy yeah I gotta
say Julian I'm actually very impressed
with that if you did really like a lot
better than I expected you to do good
well the bar was set when I got my feet
so I'm a fan of the preppy colors
because Jenna doesn't wear any preppy
clothing and I kind of think she just
would look really good in it so she's
she would never pick out this color
right here but she's not here is she
alright so this next one really says
step grandparents barbecue this is what
is that this is a nice summer pastel
color which you don't wear enough of I
love when you wear pastel I could use a
little bit more prep eNOS and I think
this little cute on you
you know I don't wear pastels today is a
great example of why I don't wear
pastels I literally just spray to him I
said okay wear it when the spray tan
goes away that's never this is a color I
want to see on you I want to see like a
me like yeah like light like oh my aunt
wants me to be soft
I want you to wear something like this
but I know you like these shirts so I
didn't want to get you something you
hate it you can see right through that
you know you see it's like it's a little
too boxy like it's making me look very
wide like
a little I don't know it's also very
see-through and very white in places I
definitely need to wear like a real bra
with this because it's just like droopy
and then also square and it's really
it's sort of not really Oh what occasion
is that shirt and like different pants
isn't wearing like foxy pants with a
boxy shirt were you okay I look like I
work in the ER but I don't do anything
here see this is what I mean like she
looks so good this collaboration would
you never vibe moving on boo they don't
wear light colors like Jerry has one of
these really long ADEA shirts thanks you
actually might have this one but this
pink one is pretty rad
because it's like a thicker material and
it's still that same like that she likes
the light blue adidas the oh my gosh
look at the material okay yeah this is a
long yeah we're to your black one yeah
it's got that rose gold I feel like
this is a safe bet this is the color is
a risk this is another thing you could
wear in the summertime on a day that's
sort of like Easter had maybe one of our
step grandparents parties barbecues you
don't have any step I might well the
only thing is I'm wearing these baggy
pants so a long shirt isn't gonna look
with my good with my baggy and you would
look good with these and literally
nothing on your legs not address these
in like
like dresslink and it looks awful with
these pants of this bra I should have
rethought this bra scenario but like
this as a dress with some honestly just
a fan of this color soft I was gonna
just get the last light color out of the
way because you clearly are just
painting just simple it's like it's just
another light color that would just pop
out when you wear it I think it's a
yellow t-shirt is the only light colors
because you're never gonna buy them for
yourself this is the last color I have
big beefy gun shows cuz I'm a girl that
is a bit arms like no all right let's
get you something you like now we're
going back to strong right
chill out there pump the bricks more
camo Jenna and her camo
she loves camo and this is really soft I
actually want to wear this but she is a
few shirts that are like baseball style
and I think it looks really rad on her
and I think she looks really cute with
it so we're getting her this gray slash
camo baseball tee oh yeah okay
really really soft that's what the
I'm talking about this would be like $7
of the army surplus hey you know what
stop comparing the things I bought you
two things at the Army Navy service
started this is way better quality just
put it on maybe every time I show you
and I don't don't say I could have found
that better I thought the surplus store
all right I'm excited about this this is
 perfect bitch this was a book
I'm talking about bees and also not like
busting out of it they made this with
someone that picks up heavy things and
mind this is my new favorite shirt this
is 10 out of 10 this is Thank You Julian
hell yeah so while on the topic of 10
out of 10 this is Capricorn
that's Capricorn on the back
no I'm putting that on you little
no it's this for you no it's that first
of all it's too small well it's white
their vault is Capricorn hell no it's
just for you
you got that at a thrift store return it
it's good for car you got that Buffalo
exchange I'll happily take it back get
it off me no I'm not putting that why
not you're a troll you put on it
you just I'm not maybe with that kappa
crap crap record you got like my nemesis
okay not only does she like these like
lace sort of see-through black shirts
because she has a few but I mean come on
this might not fit any human ever but I
had to get it because look at please put
this on okay you have two tigers
fighting Julian I'm not putting that I'm
I thought this would be fierce okay I'll
put it on over this shirt why did you
buy this because I saw those they
literally yelled at me over this shirt
but I'm not like this is not demonetised
fun times and my nipples aren't that far
apart from each other this is just gonna
be a no-show I don't think that was
meant to cover your nipples they're just
like hanging out I'm gonna give you like
a zero for that white cap of
crap that you got but like yeah like
this over shirt I retract everything
that I said yes Tommy's a really cool
blue colored stretchy denim I really
love when she wears jeans and she
doesn't wear jeans like ever figured I'd
get her this pair I just need to figure
out the sizing because it's very
different from men's but I'm getting
these yourse in a different way the next
item from H&M
I can feel my legs suffocating from yeah
I think you'll really like them they're
extra soft I got a light gray wash yeah
those are too small
how am I look at that okay they're
stretchy so if they're a little tight
that's okay show them how small that
waistband is Julian I am a grown woman I
literally say the girl with quads before
but you think my legs are gonna be in
there
they look very long they look small
entice you try them on we just did a
spray tan I'm gonna stick to them I need
you to put those on to me like that why
are you moving like oh my god they look
so good
why do you want me to be a people that
wears jeans I feel like if I move enough
in them I can't rip they're stretchy is
that a challenge like I'm sweating from
buttoning them come on I can't really
Kermit when he puts on clothes just sit
up there too tight okay this is all I
have to sit from now on I went shopping
hey your favorite store called angle
because when you shop it angle you look
really acute didn't even get that dad
you're so uncomfortable yes okay yes yes
yes look how long it is yes I love how I
wore that long shirt to VidCon people
like to know what the are you
wearing I'm like an egg out a day
nightgown bitch some edgy little rips in
it on the mannequin okay yeah a banana
can you give that to me I'll put this on
over my jeans okay all right yeah it's
me Jenny the regular people first of all

off the blood to my brain I don't mind
the flannel I feel like I always liked
