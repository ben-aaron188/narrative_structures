over here Hey ladies you tidy you beat
me to it is 20 18 I have missed you
thank you so much for letting me take a
break it was much needed as you can see
a quick hair update many of my beautiful
extensions have made it into the new
year many have died I lost a few good
men in the shower I feel like the ones
that I put on super wonky were the first
ones to come out something I've noticed
as a first-time taping hair extension
where is everyone's really complimentary
of your hair when it's on your head but
the second one comes off your head
suddenly it's disgusting which I don't
understand but during my two-week break
I had a lot of time to watch more
beautiful people videos that's right
youtubers and I was watching Tati and
people like Tati shaved their faces and
I was like let me get in on that Commack
I've never done this before obviously
because to me if someone was like shave
your face I would take a razor and
shaving cream and be like hell yeah one
time I intentionally tried to dye my
mustache darker some of the benefits
that people have described is that it
makes your skin feel really soft because
this layer peach fuzz is off and your
makeup goes on really smooth so I'm out
here 2018
my hair is still poppin I'm just on this
never-ending quest to become a snack and
what makes a snack a beautiful shaved
beard Julian when I shave my face I hope
it comes in so thick so dark and so
stably that we just get to rub beards I
really just wanted to try it I mean I
don't have really dark hair so I'm gonna
have to pull you in pretty close so I
apologize he about to get closer to my
beard then you ever want
so I would to Alta I've never been to
Ulta before um it's cool I don't know
why I told that shut up when I watched
Artie's videos she actually had this one
and she compared it with less expensive
ones like this that are completely
disposable but they also have one that
was like electric and came with like
like vibrates and it was like this whole
system that company also had like
vibrating makeup brushes and stuff too
and I was like it's time to stop if the
beautiful people are doing something I
want to try it and see how beautiful it
makes me because as you can tell over
the break I've had numerous plastic
surgeries on this road to becoming not
even an opinion but the most beautiful
person in the whole world I know my
appearance is jarring I've had a lot of
work done to look great
I want my jaw right here to just be
beaming to the gods so when you look at
me it's like you're looking at gambit
and I'm just gonna bite you with my
laser jaw
doesn't that gambits power when he takes
his glasses us know when gibbet takes
his glasses off he has lasers for our
eyes he does wanna bet we're quite
literally mixing up two rows playing
card but he also wears glasses
yeah bit
yes it is oh my god are we betting again
that that isn't the x-men song I'm
trying to shave my face not getting in
arguments me TV stop well how did you
think the excellent opening theme song
way I mean now that I think about it
that's really too bad for candid it's
like no good powers at all imagine
everyone around you because these like
sick telepathy and like shit like that
and you're like thank you shit is even
an x-men if all you can do is throw
cards it was just like a weird magician
that it was you like left the Magic
Castle look a service to its jaw let's
go and he wipes away a like my cousin
kids are playing sure he's just like a
shit guy won't stop it beast is like
covered in fur like blue fur like he's
clearly immune why is everyone just like
setting of gambit you're not a mutant
I also apologize I'm obviously not
wearing stuff on my face off oh no I
look beat okay let me know in the
comments on a scale of 1 to 10 just how
fucking beat my skin's damn show just
shave all this off yeah hold it at a
90-degree angle and do like short little
downward strokes
and that if your skin is dry it might
cause irritation oh yeah let's see this
whole thing off
I think it's not shaving my face oh look
at my chin right now do you see that all
my hair see y'all think is just peach
fuzz and that this is the game we really
hairy out here though Julie look oh my
god so the videos I watched like a
people with really dark hair and like
thick hair on their cheeks and face and
stuff it looked like so satisfying and I
was like oh my god I want that to be my
life right now where's my tank playing
cards I'm gambit look it see that look
my face is like a dusty bedroom okay it
feels pretty smooth I'm gonna do this
half of my face with this one and then
try the other one this basically just
said like you didn't use it everywhere
on your face but like it's not our fault
if you shave your whole head bitch
that's on you I was a little worried
that I was gonna be able to cut myself
really easily with this yeah just like
dry out your fucking face dude allegedly
Marilyn Monroe herself used to shave her
face cuz you know nobody wants no peach
fuzz that probably BuzzFeed is some
bullshit listen to that ooh
ASMR shaving my sideburns
I want to shave my forehead do you think
I've hair in the forehead
oh this isn't damp anymore I got a damp
in my forehead me wet
No damp wet away something damp I'm
sorry
oh it just feels good as hell here we go
oh I forgot this step where you like
lift your skin up a little yeah I do
good though what if I cut my chin and
they just cut my chin oh it feels so
good do you want to feel my face let's
decide I haven't shaved feelable the
same time no no no right that's crazy
it's not amazing yeah so it's just why
it takes off the little layer of peach
fuzz that's always on your face like I
love it can I get some fucking
aftershave do you have aftershave can I
have some yeah ja wait is this how
people on Instagram like when they take
pictures of their skin it just looks

grossest thing you've done this is like
a - what's the grossest thing I've done
probably try dyeing your mustache brown

think you're supposed to hold this one
at like a 45 degree angle do you want to
shave my face a little I mean you let me
shave your face bitch hold on let me
just do this part look at that what I'm
saying
that's like mostly sideburn yeah careful

faces short little strokes oh don't do
that okay what could they hear you just
cut off Julia this is so like fun and
relaxing okay look at all this buzz yeah
look it's on my neck this side in
general feels pretty smooth in all
directions this side feels really smooth
on this way but just by well I'm trying
to figure out which one I like more let
me go up on this one even though I never
said do that I don't care I'm over gold
my name is Dana I'm 30 and I
mustache no more best shot for my
basketball game we're gonna be

their like sort of pros and cons look at
all this peach fuzz left though you see
that there's like a lot left here look
at all the hair that this one got off
should I shave my sideburns like up into
my head
no no yeah it feels so good can you like
tell any difference though if you're
looking at me yes up close you can right
like it looks so good
I feel like this kind of thing is bad
for a Peugeot because I'm just gonna
take this and do it just a little bit
everywhere I thought that this would be
something really easy to cut your skin
with but knock on wood I have not cut my
skin we don't try it looks really good
it's glowing is it am i glowing yeah
what are you doing I feel like this is
just gonna irritate the hell out of my
skin but I was like okay so if I shaved
my face and all the little baby hairs
are gone then I could do a peel off mask
and it'll hurt a little less right
that's what I'm gonna do who you
frightened with a 5 o'clock shadow I
feel nothing I feel nothing I feel
nothing at all you see how it just like
floated off of my mustache now I can do
some violent shit to my face and it
won't hurt don't do violent shit oh my
god for real like your skin is screaming

the story spread well yeah like you know
not distribute as evenly as before look

just trying to do it fast but like cuz I
want to see my face but I've gotten it
everywhere whoa good there is no hair I
feel like my makeup has not gone on this
smooth on my face since I was like 12
years old I wasn't allowed to wear
makeup I put it on makes a difference
right like maybe you can't exactly see
it on camera but it feels so good and it
feels so good to like shave it that like
process of it takes like not very long
at all and I feel like the payoff is
amazing I haven't been this excited
about shaving something since I shaved
my eyebrows when remember I was like it
feels like something I've wanted to get
off my face for so long and then it's
finally gone like it feels like that but
just on my cheeks it just looks like
you're touched up right now really yeah
