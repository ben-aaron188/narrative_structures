I know what you're thinking this hair is
very dirty you are correct
welcome back to my channel where I'm
being incredibly selfish lately and
doing whatever I want to and having a
great time so I was falling down a
beauty hole recently like I do just
about every single day on YouTube and I
was looking up hair braiding tutorials
and I came across a bunch of tutorial
where they're putting in like ribbon and
yarn and like other bigger pieces of
hair into their hair and braiding in and
it was staying put and it just like
really got me thinking why don't we
braid other things into our hair I'll
speak for myself for years I didn't have
a purse or like pocket you know I'm
trying to stuff sup in my bra like in my
waistband or like old things in some
places
why have I ever thought to just braid it
into my hair I feel like hair is an
incredibly undervalued resource we could
have been holding our belongings in our
hair this whole time just never tried or
maybe you had like you know sometimes
stuff gets caught in your hair but I'm
talking about I'm perfect so yeah I know
you've seen the title I really just want
to try and break things into my hair
that are not hair like like a ribbon or
yarn to see if this is a viable option
for carrying your belonging and then be
able to access them moderately but
things you just braided back in so the
reason my hair is so dirty is because if
I had it like super clean I think things
would slip out it's got some grip so
here we don't let should see my help it
now prevent you're going to need your
belonging and probably like some hair
bands because you have to secure the
braids or else your belongings are going
to fall out
I wanna start with something that I
imagine a lot of people need but maybe
don't have a place for it I'm going to
Coachella and I like I'm not carrying a
bag cuz I have tiny little bras and
outfit so like I don't want to keep a
thing like a set of keys I mean trust me
I look this up on YouTube and all I can
find is people braiding like hair like
things into the hair and not so much
like their stuff I seem to have lost
control of my braids but it doesn't
matter so now I'm just going to secure
it with an elastic and now I have key
for hair so gracefully so pretty ooh
maybe this isn't the best method but let
me do the learning for you okay I mean
look at how the secureness is I feel
like I just stand over low I could drive
a car like this this is amazing and you
know it
see this is what happens when you just
think a little now I'm free to do my
thing in Coachella and as long as I'm
not spinning around and big circle
nobody is going to get hurt and my keys
stay in place I'm having a great time
and everything is great so this was the
test this works spectacular leaf now I'm
ready to move on to all of my other
belongings to see like how functional I
can make my hair and holding same thing
these aren't going anywhere if somebody
really wanted to like fuck your day up
it pull this hopefully around people to
care about you okay next thing right I'm
going to my friend's house I'm gonna
have a sleepover but I don't have
anything with me so I'm just gonna bring
my toothbrush into my hair so here we go
if you come here to judge me for how
dirty my hair is you can get out
worst-case scenario
this toothbrush is stuck in my hair for
forever after braiding this this
toothbrush is biodegradable I can stick
it in the ground or leave it in my hair
and it will eventually become one with
my hair so it won't be a problem
look at that you can't even see it my
hair is covering it up I thought you
would have this in your hair and no one
would even know that it's in there
people will just think you have was a
cool thing in your hair what you do it's
a toothbrush for later I mean look at
that tight Keys toothbrush I'm on a roll
and this is amazing I just figured out
the ultimate life hack if this doesn't
get me into the beautiful beauty
community club nothing will mix scenario
your delivery driver just gave you your
food right that you ordered and is so
excited about but but there's no
utensils inside fuck fuck fuck what do
you have a dinglehopper of your very own
in your hair so we should try to fork
out though so that's going to create a
problem later when we're doing
activities with our friends and they're
like is your head okay it's getting
stabbed with a fork and like why is
there a fourth in your chair like you'll
be jealous later I got fork for later
and you don't you have to eat with your
hands like a barbarian not me I came
prepared so when I was in school I would
just jam a pencil or a pen in my hair
why just jam it in there when you can
fuckin braid it in there hey Jenna do
you have a pen I sure do like this is
going to help you this is going to
change your life I give up on that one
because there's like a squishy silicone
II thing I know there's making it hard
so it's painful okay sandy you're also
going on another sleepover and you need
not only a toothbrush but like a nice
pair of underwear for the next day I
don't need to bring an overnight bag
because I have all of my stuff ready for
our sleepover right here maybe I should
have had my hair like slightly less
dirty because this is getting really
dramatic over here not only is this
incredibly functional but look at how
beautiful stunning like take my senior
picture today it's starting to feel a
little heavy this definitely feels a
little heavy but it's nothing I can't
handle
okay pasta doesn't work flip the pasta
sideways and try to get it in those
little holes now imagine this a whole
head of pasta so by the time you get
somewhere and they're like oh it's for
dinner and you're like pasta I brought
it all in my hair like I want to know if
you want a survivor or something if I
braided pasta into my hair is that
really against the rules because this is
my hairstyle you can't tell me how to
wear my hair and then you're the only
one that's not fucking carpet you have
carbs like you're gonna win like you can
use your hair to hold goop I think it's
fucking brilliant you're on the beach
you have like no budget because you're
in your bathing suit but your dog really
needs to go for a walk like it looks
great it feels great it is great I don't
have to hold it with my hand I am
holding it with my chair grenade beep
scream Wow when I stand up I can just
walk in like this hands-free now I can
like use my hands for all the other
things that I have to do oh I'm walking
weak am I fall like seeing how many
videos youtube de menthe
types of wine for no reason without any
notification or option to appeal someone
actually sent him this collar but maybe
he does a lot of wear that all the time
and I don't blame him you know maybe he
wants to wear one that says confidence
sometimes we just go and break it in
your hair if you jump off the table
though firm it's really going to hurt
movies so please don't do that
don't let your dog pull so that they
don't rip your hair out but other than
that like I can just about fully stand
up and walk in at the same time the way
that I did this one of the little
invasive I'll admit that much but like
look I can see in the dark whatever this
one didn't really work out that well
function beauty technology all in one
beautiful hairstyle I'm not trying to
like to my own horn or anything but
there's might be the best idea I've ever
had in my whole life I fucking hate
everybody here so I'm just gonna plug my
headphones in oh would you look at this
look they're not going to go anywhere
they're in my hair I don't want to
listen to my music anymore just rip my
headphones out they stay right there
you might unplugging from my phone look
it it's like a cool hair accessory
we've have it secret the whole time we
just didn't think of it I mean maybe cuz
it's stupid but it doesn't matter the
option is there
how okay just be careful when you're
like sitting and then you go to spin it
off because it it will rip your hair out
still want to get a little turn but just
a little I mean this one this one's with
a level-five braid if braids head level
I'm here to party get hurt just a little
bit but you can also just like totally
naked through airport security like this
because no one should even see it it's
like it's not even there no I should
take my headlamp out this was a fail
really a little bit of hair out because
we want we want to look cute you know
when you order Taco Bell and they forget
to give you all of your hot sauces you
just have your own 24/7 now I can open
my garage door from anywhere in the
world and anyone can steal my bike
okay next scenario you're going to a
party you just want to look like you're
in celebration mode so I'm going to
breathe this into my hair you are the
part oh okay what if you had a whole lot
of balloons so we're all filled with
helium and we bring them all with your
hair and then it was enough to lift you
up off the ground ladies marbles but you
got lifted up by your hair and then
probably like your scalp came up
recently so fucking dark Wow just like
this video and leave me in college that
says you would like it if I did a whole
hair full of balloon because I think
that that is a fucking next-level idea
wow this one hurt this could last you a
couple days I'm ready
I am ready to go camping I want to make
this so I can keep my Mophie in my
sweatshirt pocket and have this charge
my phone so that I can use it like at
face level like this smart hair I am
fucking smart hair look at that I'm
ready for fucking anything I'm literally
the smartest person I've ever met in my
whole life this last one I think is a
really great idea so I wanted to be
surprised and I will show you what I've
done there's giddy excitement dah dah
I'm a human Christmas tree
I mean is it stupid yeah but you know
I'm just really excited that I figured
out these are just braids things into
your hair it's just a liberating idea
like I don't need my hands for anything
anymore I have everything in here that I
could possibly need for today I know
everyone watching this right now is just
fucking jealous ah do you want to come
see my hair
what's so funny is that to a favored
bunch oh yeah
friends like radio waye are you know
white so you just take a little and use
it like I'm plugged in to an outlet
right now this is incredibly functional
earlier yes it's like the fanny pack of
hairstyles oh yeah okay it's silly but
it fucking works great let go go I am
Inspector Gadget this is go go gadget
hair there you go there's hot sauce
things are surprisingly easy to take out
and I have it done time to get fuckin
perfect my bed this is exactly right TSA
is packed your fucking bun down if you
ever go through security with a bun a
fucking squeeze that shit you're looking
for Nick so you as I like to get things
untangled just do this for long enough
you will win I thought that was gonna
take a long time and it didn't so this
proves me right yet again this is
incredibly functional cannot attend
experiment you can break things into
your hair like I know someone sent this
to permanent but I feel like it's kind
of nice on me it suits me alright make
sure you subscribe to our channel i put
interviews every wednesday / thursday I
hope you feel just like informed and
inspired that you can just braid
whatever you want into your hair it's
been life-changing for me and don't be
surprised if you see me with a bunch
ship rated in my hair from now on
because it's incredibly functional it
only hurts a little bit alright I'll see
you guys next week
I should probably wash my hair hell yeah
