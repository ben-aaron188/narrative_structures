Gumi kids love me this Paris cult I got
caught in the wind and then the wind did
my hair it's almost on fleek except it's
not at all my mom was in town this week
and we got to hang out and every time
I'm around my mom I like regress into a
five-year-old it brings me back to all
the things that I used to think when I
was a kid I was writing down a few of
them and they're actually like they made
me laugh really hard so for those of you
that don't like these videos where I
tell you things my friends see later
I've described some of these things in
videos like embarrassing stories but I
don't think I've ever explicitly said
some of the stupid ass shit that I
thought was a little kid you can let me
know if I'm crazy or you also about
things like that because you're your
little human brain just tries to figure
everything out and most of the time
you're just so wrong without further ado
here's some things I used to think when
I was a kid so the first thing that I
used to think when I was a kid if you
have a garage with a button that opens
and closes it and you keep it in your
car for when you're driving home and
you're like ready to get your garage you
put the car in the garage
I thought that your garage door opener
would open your garage from however far
away you were so we would go like on
road trips or something and my mom would
accidentally press the garage door open
yeah that's right
I know mom mom closed the garage so was
it I steal my bike what are you nuts and
she would you start dying laughing she
was like it doesn't I'm like how do you
know that you don't know that at all it
really does I bet you anything that
someone is stealing all of my
rollerblades and bikes right now and
you're gonna be sorry when we get home
and all her shit's gone bitch okay so
you better fucking click that close to
this day if anybody ever pushes their
garage door opener while they're driving
away you better close that somebody's
gonna steal your bike Vans gonna stop
good yawn the next thing I thought when
I was a kid is that if someone had hair
that you liked that you thought was
pretty like if you just ask them what
kind of shampoo they use and then you
use that shampoo that your hair would
turn into their hair there's this girl
in my school had this like really long
dark like curly hair and it was so
pretty and I was like oh my god what
kind of shampoo do you use and she told
me I went to the drugstore I begged my
mom to get that shampoo use it
I was like what the fuck my hair looks
nothing like hers this is the biggest
ripoff ever that shampoo did not do what
it said it would which was like turn my
hair into someone else's hair and I was
thoroughly disappointed same thing with
like makeup and skincare products I
thought that if I just knew what kind of
like makeup JLo or that I would look
like JLo it doesn't it's a sad sad
reality when you realize that's not the
case at all so the next thing that I
thought when I was a kid wasn't
necessarily my fault when I was a kid we
went to like church and stuff and part
of that was that we had to go to this
like Tuesday or Monday night like Sunday
at school you know what I mean for you
like read stuff and like learn about
religion so my religion teacher was
enthusiastic she used to Paul the most
ridiculous stories like miracles and
stuff and she would just pump them into
our brains to try and get as excited
about religion class who made her own
rosaries and she was telling us all
about how this one woman said so many
rosaries that it actually turned gold
because the power of God or whatever and
I don't even know if that's true but I
took this literally I was like oh my god
I want to be the person that says so
many rosaries that it turns cold mind
you the one that I made was like made
out of like little lavender plastic
beads like that bitch is not trained
gold I made it out of string like it was
fuckin shitty it's rosary ever and I was
like okay I think I can manage 10
rosaries a day so I would mark them off
on my calendar I would sit in my room I
would say 10 rosaries a day and then my
brother one day was like hey why are you
saying so many rosaries I was like dude
you gotta listen to this if you say it
enough times it'll turn gold my brother
was like same way like oh man I gotta
get a rosary my dad he saw my brother
sitting in his room like saying the
rosary my dad's like what the fuck are
you doing I'm everyone I was like well
Jenna told me if I said enough rosaries
it would turn gold my dad just looked at
him I was like fer God's sakes go pray
over the car like don't turn your rosary
into gold go turn the whole fuckin
of gold he had to sit there and explain
us that no amount of saying the rosary
was gonna turn it gold I was like dad
miracles though miracles they happen she
told us he was like your eminence
the next thing I thought was that no one
actually lived in Florida or California
so I grew up in upstate New York which
is like basically Canada Florida and
California is where you went for
vacation because Disneyland is there in
Disneyworld and I think that people work
there I didn't think that anyone lived
in either of those states at all I just
thought that the only thing that was
there was Disney and that was it like
nobody could ever be so lucky to live
anywhere near there or around there
there weren't houses it was just
Disneyland and just Disney World nobody
lived there you know like logistically
I'm not sure how that would work like no
one would be able to run the part but I
didn't think about that because those
people weren't at work
they were Mickey Mouse next thing I
thought when I was little almost
happened I almost got away with it I
almost did it so I always had like
pretty blunt bangs got it like a ton of
hair and I was getting sick of them Ryan
like 7 years old or something and I'm
like me and all my friends like don't
have bangs I want to get rid of my bangs
I thought that people that didn't have
bangs just cut them off like I didn't
realize that it was your hair also that
you had just grown out so I kept eyeing
my mom I'm like mom I want to cut my
bangs and she was like well they're
pretty short you keep trimming them yeah
but I'm gonna cut them I don't want them
anymore I want to cut them off so I'm
like going like this like I really want
to cut my bangs off and I'm almost
positive that I asked the hairdresser
I'm like can you cut my bangs off she
was like no why would you want to cut
your days off because I don't want them
anymore like no you have to grow them
out like oh oh it's a good thing I
didn't cut them off or else would have
had bangs for a really really long time
the shittiest bangs ever and the last
thing that I thought when I was a kid a
boy told me this and I thought this for
a hot second and then realized how
fucking ridiculous it was he told me
that tampons were only for teachers so
that they could go to the bathroom while
they were teaching and they didn't have
to leave the class while they're doing
it
like not for anybody else
just for teachers and just so that they
could you know stand there and go to the
bathroom while they were teaching
because they had to go so yeah those are
some of the things I thought when I was
a kid let me know if you think any of
that stuff or thought anything funny and
remember that if you're like wearing a
tampon it's not so that you can pee
while you're teaching a class so just
warning you it's not gonna work
