is that right only for my hair today
either okay
tried to reason with it earlier just
fucking have it but a really long time
since I've told you guys like anything
that's happening with my life feel like
they're gonna be do each other anymore
do you think I could make a cool video
today if I wanted to because my life and
thoughts and brain are being consumed by
something that I would like to share
with you and that thing I would like to
share with you looks like this please
consider this letter as a notice of
final all capital fucking bold letters
warning
prior to possible fine for which you
previously said - warning letter on
December 29th 2011 we should ever
fucking happened I didn't get that
Tennant was causing excessive noise
problems on the night of March 9th 2012
until approximately 5:00 a.m. there was
yelling dogs barking and running up and
down the stairs for more than five hours
also during the day on March 8th your
tenants were causing excessive noise
problems no this is not the first time
this has occurred first of all I like I
don't even know where to start with this
I don't even know where the fuck to
start so I'm just gonna pick a spot I
don't exactly remember what I was doing
March 9th I think it was a Friday or
some shit uh we might have been playing
beer pong there was certainly no more
than five people at my house how do I
know that because I don't know more than
five fucking people here staying up and
drinking until 5:00 a.m. is probably
true but just that's fucking ten points
for being amazing and awesome partying
fuck you now mind you whenever people
come over and they're like oh how are
your neighbors I'm like I don't fucking
know I don't know them I've never seen
them I'm pretty sure all the people I've
never seen anyone over there ever the
only person I've ever heard of seen
lives right there and she's a hot
fucking tranny mess like you know
weirdest live in an apartment building
and you're like I don't know if anyone
else lives here yeah that's how I feel I
never see anybody I never see anybody
coming in leaving and never hear
anything
is like mail that's been sitting out
there for since I moved in like six
fucking months ago they have like
newspapers and shit like I don't even
know what anyone fucking lives here
except the deaf girl the thing I'm
having the hardest time wrapping my
brain around is like of all the times
I've like had really noisy friends over
or a party like I don't know all of
college or any of that fucking shit of
all the times that I've made so much
noise I'm getting a written guess how
much this - a thousand dollars I'm
pretty sure this night that girl that
lives there came and knocked on the door
at like 11 or something like that and
was like hey can you guys keep it down
were like yeah sure sorry that's the
only time anyone's ever complained about
noise ever and it wasn't like the cops
busting in and being like everyone needs
to break it up and get out of here all
five of you get the fuck out too noisy
and when she knocked on the door to
complain guess what we were fucking
doing guess what we're doing go I will
give you one guess ready go nope you're
wrong we were playing sorry the board
game all fucking rollicking game of
sorry the other thing that's ridiculous
is it's not like we play loud music we
have like a stereo we don't even use it
guess when we play music on like a
little iPod dock okay it sits on the
kitchen counter and like it doesn't go
louder than like your fucking computer
or shit like that it's not like bumping
music there's never any people outside
the doors are all closed the windows are
all closed everything's fucking just
we're playing sorry bitch so now that
you have the idea of you know the
incident that fucking occurred let me
just tell you about her okay reason why
this is so aggravating is because she is
so fucking noisy and I've never
complained I've never said anything
nothing she
to work in like the fucking nightlife
industry or like bartending or something
because she has a fucking
state-of-the-art laser lightshow in her
fucking apartment building she like if
you walk past the house at night
sometimes there's like fucking bumping
music like just look straight house
music I like it out I like tilt the
walls vibrate it's that's what it is and
then she's got these fucking laser
lights and they're going crazy but the
weirdest thing is that you never hear
any people there's never any cars parked
outside there's never any like like yeah
like there's no talking there's no
nothing there's nothing there's never
any it's like she throws herself a rave
she raves her face off alone and she
does that until like fucking seven
o'clock in the morning on like Mondays
like if anything she's probably just
pissed they weren't over here having a
great fucking time playing beer pong and
sorry til the wee hours of the morning
and she's just raving in her fucking
house alone then to make things worse
she has some of the most awkward loud
sex I've ever fucking heard like it's it
lasts for like five minutes and she's
got this like weird moaning like oh so
girls it's so weird and it just it
doesn't even sound fun honestly but like
fuck is this fucking bitch to complain
and I seriously just have a problem with
the fact that this isn't even fucking
true this isn't even true we weren't
running up and down the stairs with my
dogs chasing behind us like barking like
fucking rabid walls that were you
talking about we were sitting and or
standing at a table drinking alcohol
there's no running and barking involved
in that and what is this fucking shit
like I was being too loud on the on
Thursday March 8th hey you know what's
really fucking loud when you sit in your
house at your computer all day
you fucking keep it down over there
you're so noisy like I know I'm yelling
right now because I'm pissed off it's
not all I talk
talk like this all the time I'm pissed
the fuck off I'm just like this girl's
such a fucking hypocrite dude like you
can't complain about other people's
noise when you make so much fucking
noise it doesn't work like that okay but
like I don't want to start a war with
her anything like I'm trying to just
keep the peace but I'm just pissed off
that if I ever want to play sorry or
beer pong with five fucking people again
it's gonna cost me a thousand dollars
like listen bitch
this is fucking America all right and I
deserve to have the right to play beer
pong and sorry with five friends if I
want to on Friday night and listen to
Pandora radio on a fucking iPod touch
okay fucking fuck you fuck you fuck your
face fuck your stupid raves that you
have by yourself you're just pissed off
they have no friends and I'm sorry that
I just made a really long video talking
about this but I just I couldn't I
couldn't even concentrate today I could
not do anything else except talk about
how much of a bitch she is so now it's
out there and now I feel much better
oh really

living room quietly make sure you
