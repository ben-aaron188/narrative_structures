skills that I do not have he is making a
face you do oh that's not poor shadow

teaspoon of Chinese five-spice that goes
I mean I'm not the most gifted chopper
but like this is nice and even yeah you

most fuckin bomb
I really don't think that I've had a
vegan dumpling ever of you it's so good
though it was really good oh my god he
just dumped in sesame oil into here I'm
cooking oil the merrier
this is like one trillion size serving
like you could eat all of this this
calls for eight ounces of flour and not
some regular ass measurement and then
4.5 ounces of hot water
yeah hot water hotter one this isn't
really looking at right
am i that double the measurements
incorrectly wait this is like not dough
whatsoever this is your suppose it's
really what we do here add water when
you root it ungrateful am I gonna make
you dumplings Oh way too much stop
screaming people make dumplings for fun
hey you want to go out and do some pick
up dumplings
I got a dumpling game but you only had
one entire meal after this so he like
rolled it out but then he cut it into
even little things if you would just
chill out
you go girl stop dumpling managing me oh
my god this is so many fucking dumplings
don't worry all you have to do is
individually carefully craft them
we put flour on here and roll them out
individually until I just want to die
oh that's heck Niek so much work Julian
or you just say that you're fine when
you're not really full Wow it's all
broken and cracked and ugly there that
looks like his what the hell Julian you
asked me what I wanted I mean there's a
reason we don't eat dumplings because
this is ridiculous mmm I'm hungry I want
to spend the next seven hours making my
food
I will never uncovered kind of time
that's your face getting more and more
frustrated than when you do this I feel
like this is the kind of dish that would
break me is like I'm gonna cry
like they make you do this in like
culinary school so it breaks you see it
weeds out all the people that aren't
serious about it it's crazy how quickly
I can eat one of these for all the work
that goes into it let's see if this is
even gonna work like that much yeah then
it goes like this and then he folds it
and pinches it what about this that
works right say that you're fine and
you're not really fine you just can't go
it's all broken free flour does that
song but you told me this was gonna work
lying to me remember how I said this the
kind of thing that I feel like is gonna
break me I just made another round of
dough head a logo another recipe with
some xanthan gum and tapioca starch
because that one had nothing to like
make it sticky it's just breaking apart
if this doesn't work I'm gonna cry and
we're just gonna starve okay
what's that bite and that kidding like
potatoes that's what I feel like I know
ah that's a great thickness but it's so
thick with to seize know how he does
this so nicely
like he just dips his finger in there
one time and it's like all wet
a child oh my god fold-over pinche guy
doing so good fold-over pinche guy
that's just being fancy wait so you can
do this without being fancy because do I
look like a fancy person to you
publics god-awful hey what are you
talking about looks really good look
okay I don't know what we're gonna do
with the rest of this family but they're
not gonna be dumplings okay I'm making
like a couple of dumplings to eat
because I've already had it it's
basically gonna be Thanksgiving by the
time I'm done fuck I don't like
dumplings anymore I just decided I'm
allergic to dumplings you know yeah you
know what never had a dumpling don't
want one I heard they're bad well I even
eat it
they're my favorite food have some
respect I want to move on with my life
okay I want to get excited about my life
crying sing doctor how much dough that
is that's so wrong it's gonna be like
that hell yeah you're a nervous wreck
know what look at that oh yeah it's a
perfect looking dumpling I literally
bought it at the store like that it
looks like a dinosaur here look we'll
stretch it out Oh God you ever just like
make dumplings in cried calm oh no this
is squares Oh whoever invented dumplings
is like a sick bored fuck for dumps for
dumps oh my god okay all right I made $4
I love you bitch Yeah right
these better be the best dumplings
you've ever had because let me tell you
something this is not worth it that's
probably good
fuck right look what this recipe calls
for this is bullshit what year is it
this round if we're gonna do something
we're gonna do it right well that's so
good
sesame oil no you put the dumplings in
all four dumplings or just I can't we
just like make mashed potatoes like
everybody else is today can I at least
like start the rice right now for the
meal after this get this look tell your
family we're not we're only bringing
dumplings for this yeah for don't bring
one dumpling Thanksgiving take that
middle part out when you rude as hell
that was the best part of my day right
there look good are they done I think I
feel like we're too hot to eat there's
only one way to test it
whoa an apple teeth way too hot
Oh crunch these are delicious
very good they're so good yeah no it
cooks perfectly they're like good crispy
on the outside but like softer on the
inside the filling this was worth all
the stress and and fury that you went
through really it's delicious you know
give me a rating out of 10
honestly yeah for a vegan 9 I think
really yeah and 9 you got a night that's
almost worth it is it fun layering I
left my beer on the counter but I'm
having a good leader tunnel ha ha
oh that's Olga the job to a filling
ratio is like there is more dough but
the flavor is really really good the
hard work was worth it you did a good I
still feel pretty defeated with Julian
oh oh don't get my leisure suit dirty I
kind of want to wear it to Thanksgiving
this time I'm just gonna prep the
vegetables and stuff but I'm gonna get
I'll show you how to do the tofu takes 7
hours to chop everything so I saved you
the pain of watching me cut again green
onion leek some garlic some ginger just
a little bit of bok choy celery peanuts
this is almost the same as the dipping
sauce a little different it has some
cornstarch in there but it's very
similar these are some Thai chili
peppers because Julian is fucking wild
in the butt breading for the tofu
because Julian can't just have tofu it
needs to be breaded to keep from
business I feel like there's a theme in
your in your favorite foods here to this
tribe deep fried flour half corn starch
yes this this also goes in the batter
peaceful amazingly this is not a
high-speed slow-mo feature that is the
signal is you sue-baby so go ahead and
reuse your oil the scar to emotionally
the first time why are all your recipes
like dangerous does it make your food
taste better if it's like kind of
dangerous yes absolutely yes market your
favorite food be like mac and cheese
aside from me who's your best friend
you know what their icemakers is you
don't have to like me fast yeah I don't
like to go fast I like to go slapping
everywhere I don't like this you know
like what that meant
well it looks fine to me I think this is
probably good enough I like cannot wait
for this to be over because I'm done
with the hot oil today is for dessert no
no yeah that's great I'm too dainty in
Virgo I can't do this then you mix it
around and you have this Paula stuff oh
it's hot oh my god
my god it makes you feel like out the
car oh this like hurts my nostrils right
Julian I feel like I can't breathe I
feel like I'm dead it only took me all
day and night I've been slaving over
this for hours you've literally been
slaving over this for hours and I've
watched all of it the dumplings is the
hardness this is much easier would be
like the mastership so she's beyond me
okay I gotta wait a sec yeah that's fine
such a distinct flavor which is better
though this is a dumpling this really I
mean is it cuz I cryed into the dumper
excuse me one of my all-time favorite
dishes and you completely nailed it
this is worth it really so fun good you
strap oh man in the peanut yeah I love
you thank you you score out of ten ten
really this wasn't done thank you so
much this is like really fucking great
and the whole time I was just leisure in
and also camera Manning but mostly these
you're in I know you have to be patient
today which you're not used to being but
like isn't it nice having someone cook
for you yes the patience was difficult
but it's very nice it's really good I
totally get why these are your
Comfort boots but like there's nothing
comforting about hooking this it's so
violent and intense and just like really
stressful oh well you did you never dick
you've now my favorite dish so thank you
