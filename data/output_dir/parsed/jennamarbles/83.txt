okay sorry for trolling last week no I'm
not so I had a bunch of thoughts
floating around in my head I didn't know
what to do with them so I decided to
make them all open letters open-ended
put them out in the universe to things
and people so that everyone can hear
them just because usually open letters
are like kind of serious sometimes
though and my first open letter is dear
open letters like split up and take it
easy feel like replying if any of these
affect you feel free to go ahead so I
wrote all these down and I'm gonna read
them here we go this is really difficult
because I had my contacts then and my
glasses

house every day why is your dog

I said Italian Greyhound and she said oh

before and I know it left a deep scar on
you I think just one hit that you're
healthy and I love you just the way that
you are okay and my last open letter is
something very special and exciting for
months people have been asking me one of
those things on your phone these I'm

friend Chris's pop sockets I'm gonna
take em off I put mine up there is a
carbon one of Marvel's one and a galaxy
Kermit in Marvel's for those of you that
haven't seen any of the snapchats or
videos or whatever where I'm holding
them you don't know what they are I'm
going to show you really quick so you
can just use one in the middle or you
can use two if you have a bigger phone
like me so you just stick it on there on
your case on your phone whatever you
want mine is on my case that holds like
my credit cards and stuff and so they go
in like this for when you want your
phone to be normal and then you can pop
them out my phone was a little smaller
this would be like a stand like this but
since my phone's big no it's like that
so this is how I play pokemon go there
