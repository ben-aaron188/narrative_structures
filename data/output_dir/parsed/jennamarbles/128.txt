talk about it too much but we're pretty
serious made a whole video about it
subscribe how did you get into makeup
did you go to cosmetology school or
anything um I was just like really
really good as a kid and as an adult at
everything so basically I had to pick
anything cuz I was good at everything
and I just picked makeup because I don't
ever need any and I'm not even wearing
any makeup so you're you're wearing a
little lipstick and um no no knowing any
makeup are we alive well then why are
you like doing makeup if you're not
wearing any makeup because they're like
making other people look as good as I do
or try I can't make any promises
just like your poor skin my time is
really precious like I have poor skin
your skin is poor it asked me for money
on the way in there are we gonna do
go ahead okay I guess we'll start with
some David Beckham foundation so we'll
just like dabble along on each side so
when you're doing a makeup normally
you're gonna be doing it to yourself so
you won't have a person who's being
difficult
am I being difficult yeah you're like
moving I'm not trying to move your skin
just ask me for money again
these are the best tools you can ever
use you can train yourself you don't
need tools although I will be using a
lot of tools okay we're done with the
foundation I don't feel like you got it
everywhere
okay fine I'll use one of your crappy
tools to fix it so we can cover every
inch of her skin can you do me a favor

my mouth yeah so the first time
something is in your mouth today let's
make your forehead brighter than your
future won't be that hard can you look

Greek children yeah you gotta get the
best stuff sacrifices need to be made
somewhere and I'm not gonna make them
