well I'd fallen down another beauty Hall
knows me to watch my snapchat another
marvel posted earlier this week I
couldn't stop watching acrylic nail
tutorials shout-out to nail career
education Susie you have some damn fine
entertaining videos on the channel lady
okay and you make it look beautiful and
easy and I haven't had a karlik meal
since one time in college one time
before that had them in high school I
bit them in half because I can't have
them on my fingers they make me insane I
tweet it out should I get acrylic nails
talking out of it and people are going
to it is gross do I know they're all
fucked up I still want to do it but I
kind of don't really want to sit in the
nail salon or if you are it's been done
I don't want to have them be too nice
like fuck it man I'm going to try to
give myself some acrylic nails and I
don't know what's going to happen so I
went to the beauty supply store I got
all of the things that I need and this
was meant as no shade or disrespect to
any nail techs out there I know what you
do is incredibly artistic and
complicated and a skill and then I am
not qualified to do it but I really want
to try because it is like some of the
most relaxing content that I found on
YouTube to watch someone just gently
shape a little acrylic nail so thanks to
nail career education I know that
there's two types of acrylic nails you
can see chip or you can do nail horns I
like to nail forms because they look
exciting this is the only size that I
find it's literally 500 nail form I
really know what I need to do to my
nails in order to prep them okay I'm
going to pluck them I'll be home in a
body bag
did your fingernail girl hey guys
welcome back to 2008 hot Channel right
about now I'm going to show you how to
be extra 3008 hot you push go get
yourself some acrylic nails I also have
to deeply apologize to Kristine of
simply no logical she doesn't do any
kind of acrylic nails oh I'm sorry
well how's it going over to the dark
side I have three different colors of
acrylic powder I got clear pink and
bread weights I'm really going to try
I'm going to go for it I'm going to give
myself a beautiful French manicure
here's my acrylic liquid I'm going to
pour some in the dish oh that smells my
god
so I put the priming liquid all over and
let this dry you put your fingernail
under there and then you like wrap it
around your fingers like that okay wow
I'm having a hard time already and I'm
just sitting sticker this is going to be
hard as fuck that's not going to make a
good nail it helps to like stick it
together because we just go make a pony
which nail and I'm going to get my
powder ready pink I'm like legit so
nervous and my eyes are burning from
this acrylic liquid going to get my
brush all wet I think like kind of
stalling because I'm legit fucking
terrified so one thing she stress a
whole bunch was like the liquid to
powder ratio which I don't fully
understand so we're just going to do our
best
alright then she held it in the liquid I
need a ball oh oh oh oh damn it we got
to work faster again it's literally not
sticking at all oh my god oh my god oh
my god oh it's hardening oh it's on my
cuticle so the girl you are a liar this
is impossible
Oh what the fuck it's a little balls of
it oh that is good oh that's not too bad
at all so Allah grant okay that's a good
little oh no oh oh oh it's a blood bath
imagine me like leaving these on and
going to the nail salon and trying to
get some sake like girl where did you
get these okay
look at that look at that Oh WT the
great the craftsmanship girl look is
this nail really I'm trying my best
I swear to God how can I tell us in the
drugstore and be like like your acrylic
nails like I think they'll fuck not
working with so far it is so ugly it
looks like candy corn me and Mimi mail
forms is a way to not go God as a man
look it's like dripping
like tell me if you saw girls me like
that you really can I'm very that set
that even bad oh my god it feels awful I
hate it oh it's like I glued my finger
shot oh my god oh it hurts
well okay shoot it was the worst idea oh
hey God I'm not gonna lie though this is
probably like the most fun I've had
doing my nails in a long time this is
really fun it just feels terrible I feel
like I'm gonna whip my whole like
fingernail off Jo that is so nasty Wow
ten out of ten would never recommend
doing this and oh oh I want to like cut
it this was the worst idea and make it
this long
oh I hate the feeling when it touches
something and it pushes in here oh you
hear that so what's fuckin sold I mean
like there's no hope for me ever being
able to do this it looks wrong it feels
wrong it is wrong
I need like a saw why do they make it
that thick it doesn't even look like a
nail and they're like this is a disaster
not even looking any better than filing
it for so long
it still looks so bad touch it yeah so
creepy I can't touch these now are you
going to do anything what do you like it
no for your surfboard that's a little
bit underneath looks like I'm actually
really proud either is hope for me to
have beautiful acrylic paint all that
fucking her since then thinner
even thinner this one is a monstrosity
oh that's looking better if we're
talking stuff oh no oh there's more than
enough link holy shit not making a
mistake again oh sorry hardened oh oh
the yeah of a not opaque and there's
like gross black nail file in it alright
I'm still a little clear just a well
clear oh God
it's definitely shorter so I'm hoping
for the best
small drag I don't seem out slightly
better you look elegant it probably
might cost a step of competitiveness
I tried to file I just left this one and
finished this one came out so much
better it's like then look at how thick
that is
and then I tried to file it down more
because it feels awful I really don't go
through every nail file in the world and
not get this I really for the sake of
trying I should try one with the tip so
I'm going to glue this on here and I try
to file it down with a little bit but I
literally can't do anything with my
hands anymore see if it comes out any
better isn't this enough nail glue oh
okay there's no moving it now I said it
is so hard it's definitely this should
be the easiest part
you nasty all right you know what I'll
make it stick acrylic liquid powder are
you know happy you wait on this great
wow this is significantly easier without
having to make this stupid end I should
have done this from the beginning
well we got was nicer it look why did I
do this with these like sounds really
idiot I'm I like this why I like this I
think that was pretty good
Oh moving into the point of no return
fixed territory while this beautiful one
drive I'm going to finish my pinky and
song with tips because oh my god this is
so much easier that oh girl my little
cameras like dying come on eat I'm just
going to finish these up yes you've
already seen the process I don't give a
fuck I should have given a thought oh my
god okay album's done it's cooked I'm
going to start filing this one alright I
have done the thing you know it's not
like the worst thing I've ever done
once I get started using the tip like
this is manageable but holy shit
like I need to soak this in acetone
immediately I can't do anything with
this
like ethnic with some college I'm here
you know cover up all the skanky shit
that I did it looks like a beautiful
French manicure uncovered and nailed up
filing these little shits down is one of
the worst thing I was holding my pinkie
like this case do it I wanted it ever
designed it ended compiling forever and
I didn't win like yeah
putting your curling on there is easier
but this piece for fucking ever like
none of them look the same oh the
fingers like throbbing anytime I do
anything with it
Wow Wow I've done it y'all I've drawn
blood from filing so hard I have been
filing my life away over here like I
thought the tips were so much better
until I started filing them and they're
just hard to fight
it's fucking miserable I do feel
definitely like better I'm dying to self
use an acetone so I think I'm going to
do that honestly I can't take this one
anymore it is so painful this literally
says for acrylic nails cut them down to
natural size and then soak them like how
am i put the cut pit it's like half an
inch
get it off me divided these two I'll
just be here listening to my tune hug me
daddy bet update I've been soaking these
two nails for like an hour
and this says 98% acetone but I think
that 2% will make a really big
difference because they're not coming
off this is like one of the worst
decisions I've ever made this is like a
hundred layers worst decision I've ever
made this is right up there like I have
to get this off and I don't know how
fucking help me kids don't play with
acrylic this is fucked up the other ones
look okay sort of but like oh my god I
think I've reached the moment of madness
should I try it oh my god
and cut it oh my god oh and you'd like a
saw
i legit need a saw I can't even cut it I
can't cut it what do I do
listen to me kid don't do nail form not
even one not even one time it's like the
middle of the night at this point I have
filed myself into another dimension I
somehow managed to salvage my pointer
finger nail with an on/off mixture of
acetone and tiling I wouldn't really
ruined my table and not one place at em
places I've drawn blood again and I mean
we let's take a look at that reveal
I don't know what the fuck I was
thinking this is a terrible idea
the tips came out different shapes than
the form and they all just feel really
awful this one is still outrageously
sick I honestly was just trying to
remove it and I couldn't get it off so
this is the best I could do it took me
forever because it's not like I have a
drill oh I'm so mad I fell to doing this
I want to bite them all in half I hate
it but this feels good but that's it
before after these two all read because
they so can ask the temper our which I'm
sure it's probably dangerous for you but
I don't have a choice right now I think
this is going to be a new look it's
going to catch on one hand acrylics one
hand no acrylics I'm going to have to
find a salon as soon as I can because I
can't get these off
I really can't I'm covered in filing
dust I look like a mess oh you know I
think this is a good idea if you had
like six times more money but it would
cost to get your nails done like ten
times four times I'm extremely tired my
arms are tired
hands are tired al I got cramps in my
hands the worst thing I've ever done and
it's not even worth it look at that
mediocre at best they're all different
shapes different colors different sizes
I want to die moral of the story is Suzi
girl you lied to me this is a terrible
idea they don't feel good they don't
feel rich I mean that's pretty fun well
make sure you subscribe to my channel
