life's too short not to have really
exciting here I've already done two
videos like this what a girl's hair
means and what a girls makeup means and
I'm sitting at the nail salon getting
these super festive Christmas nails Wow
and the woman sitting next to me was
like 50 ish years old and she was like
oh those are so fun I can never do that
I'm like bitch why not like you're a
grown-up you do whatever you want so I
really got to thinking a girl's nails
say an awful lot about her personality
so I should probably make that video but
for the sake of time I did paint some of
these on fake nails so get ready
huiji hooker hooker shit yeah so here is
what a girl's nails me if a girl has
bare nails or no nail polish on that
means you can paint your nails
what short nails mean I actually need to
do things with my hands on occasion so
fuck you nail polishes chipped or hasn't
been done in a long time just means I
don't have time to sit around painting
my fucking nails all day okay
nails that are grown out too long with
nothing happening means you can cut your
nails holy dick you can cut your nails
round nails mean when they ask me square
eyes then whatever and then I got this
wrong nails also means I'm conservative
except not in the bedroom or the living
room or the kitchen or on top of the
washing machine or my car or in your
dad's cars stiletto nails mean I hate
children or when no one's looking I'm
really good at picking my nose they also
mean I gave all my hand jobs like this
or like this square nails mean when I
was at the salon they asked me to square
out I said yeah sure whatever in they
gave me this square nails also mean I
tweak everything that I'm thinking and
then I tweet about how I think about
everything that I'm thinking about and
so these emojis of a male's a French
manicure means one of three things I'm
going to prom today I'm getting married

babies red nails means that I love red
so much and my nails red and my lips red

breathing by myself once Coachella I'm
on garrix when spring break kind of
needs coffee I just take Molly nail art

touch with me and you don't hear from me
for like three hours don't worry I'm not
dead I'm just getting a tiny squirrel

get that time back but you know what
it's fucking worth it look at all this
jazz holy dick
glitter nails means I'm five shots of
tequila away from taking my bottoms off
making out with my sister and then her
friend and whoever that guy is

then take a bunch of selfies hashtag no
bottoms hashtag no filter
I follow cache I got everything that
girl still fell in the shower brooklet
rape nails of something written on them
means you didn't choose the thug life
and the thug life didn't choose you
either

gift card - Hot Topic ok then they
already have everything is in there so
there's no Hot Topic
nails that are too long mean look I
don't do anything with my hands and if I
do I do it with my mouth or don't do it
at all
it also means I can only do cardio touch
can't even lift up groceries there's a
whole bunch of jobs that I can never
have with nails like this I could be the
world's most obnoxious court
stenographer there's no way I could be a
chef I would never be very good at
playing video games can't get my
contacts out I could never be a
pediatrician hey there little Billy how
you doing
alright turn your head and cough I could
never be a masseuse I mean unless my
customers were like absolutely freaks
you can't be a dentist for sure you
could never be a surgeon with nails like
this just drop something into your body
and let me just fish it out you could
never be a gynecologist put your feet in
the stirrups and I can't seem to find my
little clam pyb thing to open you up so
uh just open up I've never be able to
play catch with you
