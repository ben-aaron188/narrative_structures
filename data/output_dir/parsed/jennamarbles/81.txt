hey friends first of all close-minded
eyeshadow people can leave hi open vine
and eyeshadow people there is no easy
way for you to follow up what happened
last week I'm completely overwhelmed
with their response that I got from that
video and thank you so much for liking
it and enjoying it I'm glad you did
my skin is okay and I think most of it
has to do with the fact that you guys
prayed for me you know
thank you for your praise I've done two
of these videos I made myself an outfit
Marvel's Kermit and Peach outfits and
ever since I made that one people were
asking me to make Julianne my boyfriend
and outfit so I was trying to think of
what I wanted to make for him and I was
like I should do a Disney Princess I
should make him interests and so I know
Julian who's your favorite Disney
Princess and he says Princess Peach and
I was like that's not a Disney Princess
but I respect your wishes
so that's what I'm going to do today I
am going to make Julian into Princess
Peach like Nintendo Princess Peach you
want to come in here and say hello hello
are you excited yeah do you know any
Disney Princesses yeah Elsa so that's
the first one that comes to mind
okay you know riding this is the picture
that I'm going to use for my inspiration
and we went to the fabric store much -
Jillian's enjoying I love the fabric
store how do you think about this you
need to not need a thread no get you out
of my stuff alright this is kind of
ambitious but I think I'm going to make
a hoop skirt first so what I'm going to
attempt to do is I use a piece of scrap
fabric from my other fashion boutique
video and I have this hula hoop left
over from our conjoined twins videos I'm
going to tie these strengths of the hoop
and then this waistband for Julian and
make a little hoop skirt you gonna be
the prettiest princess that all the land
Jolie know every week I make a giant
mess
in a different room in my house oh no up
in the middle and then tie that around
your waist and see what happens it works
it's even - look at that no no that's
not no oh my dress I'll do that one this
goes under your dreads know this guy
like this no it goes under your like
this cuz I can clip my mat and my
cellular phone like right like right
there no that would to have 10 times
better than I thought it was going to I
did get like some tulle and petticoat
material to somehow try and make this
skirt a little more full um I know this
is by no means enough to actually make
it that way but I'm hoping if I like
fuck with it a little bit it will be so
I think I'm gonna glue this stay with me
to the waistband of the hoop skirt I
just ate
so this could be a disastrous idea wish
me luck
Oh Julie why did you tie it so high
thank you for making the dress but I
appreciate you tell me I can't be this
worked
no you're a fucking genius I can't do
this oh you're gonna be such a pretty
princess
alright I'm gonna move on to the dress
are you excited Wow Julian I sadly
realized ooh you have some jazz going on
I did not estimate how much fabric I
would need and correctly so we decided
to skip on some of the back material so
that I can make you a top well do that
I'm gonna break it
stop sorry this much to make the top
with I could put like a dark pink panel
in the back maybe I mean your skirt
looks really good though you look like a
little cupcake I mean you're looking
pretty nice I'm gonna make you some
sleeves and a little collar starting to
come together your jet is wretched
fashion Stallone we're gonna make you a
boyfriend until you girlfriend this a
pretty pretty princess I'm gonna start
working on these hip things I think my
plan is to just make like two
pillows and I bought some stuffing I'm
just going to stuff them up bruh
complete I've been giving some serious
thought to these sleeves and I think I
thought of a way to bypass making actual
sleeves with an elastic to poop them up
all I have is a rubber band and I don't
think that'll fit around Julian's bicep
what I think I'm gonna try to do is
create pillows for his shoulder and then
either hot glue them or velcro them to
his shirt so that they look like sleeves
but they are in fact not I'm limited to
this very strange piece of fabric shape
I'm going to do the best I can
okay so I finished one sleeve even
though it's just a shoulder pillow
deception I'm still good at it yeah oh
yeah
Wow nailed it boom bang oh wow fuck I'm
talking about
don't rub any of this out I'm trusting
you
how's this for can I press the button if
you must be pro feels good I mean it
looks like a pillow
okay stop at the dog talk pretty alright
I've made it to decorating finally I
have some papers I'm gonna make Princess
Peach's crown with this is what I could
find in terms of making a large jewel
for the front with some clear glue these
big jewels I think I'm going to use for
the ground and the earrings well one
thing's for sure
you're gonna be glittery in the chest
it's not perfect but I couldn't find a
jewel this large glued oh it's getting
hot glue all over the table
black alright I made your earrings
really quick Julianne be excited for
earrings yes alright I got these
super-strong magnets so they can really
pinch the fuck out of your ears
oh baby that's gonna look pretty drinks
done we just need your crown thought I
have white gloves somewhere but you're
just gonna have to imagine the white
gloves because I didn't have any nicely
even if I did have white gloves they
wouldn't pick your hands being defined
right spot I don't think anything about
this is the right spot can you see
yourself yet I'm gonna tuck in these
fabrics in your empty spot of that
I'm an empty spot do it from Karla Baehr
nugget
I'm always want to fit in a little Mario
Kart and race with this if you can do it
you can do it actually yeah are you
ready for this yeah where do you think
take a damn good-looking princess I'm
the princess okay this joy won't happen
here I wanted to fly so I let my laptop
know Julian stop doing that you're gonna
break it
how do you like it
I think it's nice I like it because it's
like incredibly dysfunctional sometimes
it looks good Julian does the outside
match the inside finally my insides not
dysfunctional so no it matches nothing I
think you look so pretty Gillian I'd say
ten out of ten what would you rate your
Jenn is ratchet fashion boutique
experience 9.5 perfect I'm what this is
I could have actually walked in it give
us a walk I can't it's lighting did you
break it you look like a tornado
princess that's actually that should be
my name is a tornado princess give us
like one good hard twirl this is a great
dress for the ball because I could go to
the ball and wear this dress but I can
also fit like a beach ball in the dress
too
so it's like
here my fanny packs I just need some
zippers installed can you do that
feedback

favor it's decorative oh this is
functional this is the only functional
part of the south and then up here we
got three carat carat
it's just ruby gold blue your like your
earrings yeah close the back is he added
in these extra fabric panels so you
can't see the tool you're not be able to
fit that through the door and fit
through doors yeah you have to like
that's like making a key that's not
compatible for keyholes you have to pick
it up sideways and oh the princess
