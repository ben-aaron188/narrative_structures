raise your hand if you're on opiates he
went to the dentist and though he's
drunk go home Kermit here drew Kermit
are you drunk i drunk i drunk i drew so
I'm not like the busiest person ever
I've certainly been busier at other
times in my life but I was thinking
about some stuff that I just don't have
time for and I feel like I could have
all the free time in the world and I
still wouldn't have time for certain
things because they're dumb but I can't
say that ain't nobody got time for them
because some people certainly do have
time for some of these things or want to
do that but I just fucking don't because
to me they're stupid so wanted to make
video about things that I don't have
time for for no good reason other than
their dumb first thing I don't have time
for I don't have time to make my bed
pretty sure everyone's parents at some
point tells them that they need to make
their bed too which everyone's argument
is fucking why like you're just gonna
sleep in it and mess it up why would I
ever make my bed unless someone was
coming over and I was trying to impress
them with my bed which is no one so why
the fuck would I spend ten extra minutes
every morning making my bed and list
them in the fucking military but unless
someone's gonna come by and give me a
grade on how I made my bed there's no
fucking way I'm gonna make my bed in the
morning ever the solution to making your
bed really is just like sleeping less
violently because if you just sleep
really nicely in your covers and stuff
they stink are nice then you can just
pull it up to me that's making my bed
because I don't have fucking time to
sleep like an asshole and make my bed
every morning this one I tweeted the
other day I put my hair up right and I
like miss a piece of hair or like
there's a piece of hair like sticking
out somewhere I don't have time to
fucking fix my hair and redo it
No I ripped that shit out you can't be a
part of this team you're gonna get out
of my head right now because I don't
want to grab a bobby pin your bobby pins
are everywhere but you can never find
one when you need one so you know what
I'm ripping that fucking hair out
because I don't have time when there's
hair that's being really to put it back
in my head you're done you're out you're
cast off the head Island by also having
to do with hair I
not have time to get my hair done on an
appropriate schedule I'm a brunette and
my roots grew up brunette if you meet a
girl and she has roots chances are that
means that you found yourself a fucking
student or someone with a 95 job or
someone that gives a fuck about other
shit other than their hair if you meet
someone that costly has their roots done
I don't know I'd be wary of that person
unless they're a gay man then that means
that's your new best friend out of time
to tie my shoes I leave all my sneakers
with the shoelaces just tied and then
just Jam my foot in there you know why
the fuck would I tie them and then untie
that when I can just jam my foot in it
and you know you walk around a little
bit and they get better they figure
their own life out I don't have time to
clean my fucking car I know for many
people having a nice clean car is the
priority they want they like taking
their car to the carwash like washing
the car I am NOT one of those people
okay my car is like a fucking garbage
wheels on it I like go to 7-eleven I'm
like drinking my fucking muscle milk or
some shit now when you're done with that
we're gonna clip this chin oh deli
it goes there that's where it goes back
there the rest of the garbage
we're gonna clean that out me maybe
someday if someone needs to sit there
but not right now
fuck that I don't have time to do a
laundry I like to see how long I can go
without doing laundry actually it's kind
of fun it's like a fun game you just get
to wear everything that you own one time
and then do like 50 loads of laundry at
once and I also don't like to fold my
clothes you know where it goes and Rory
jam it in there done that's where my
things go it's up to you to figure out
if they're dirty or clean it's a fucking
choose your own adventure it's a game
except when you put something on it
smells like dog pee then the game's over
and I've said this in a video before but
if I can't put it in in the dryer and
the washer and dryer like it needs to be
dry and clean I don't own it
I don't vomit I have nothing to do with
it and if it's dry clean only and it
survives the washer in the dryer you can
stay but if you get ruined and fucking
big gun because you're too
high-maintenance for me I don't have
time to drive you to some shit you're
done my child drive yourself dressed I
like most spoiled people with internet
connections don't have time to watch TV
when it's on TV
No I would much rather watch a recording
of it at some other time that is more
convenient for me because hashtag I'm
selfish
I would like to extrapolate on my nails
video if your nails are like way grown
out it just means that girl has fucking
priorities I have Christmas nails and
it's almost the end of January if you
made a girl and she just has like some
really out-of-date festive grown out
nails that just means she has a job or
something to do during the day the only
thing that my nails match is the fact
that I also don't have time to take down
my Christmas trees I'm still being
festive I'm not done that's just
beautiful why would I take it down Jenna
why do you have two Christmas trees
outside of your business I'm gonna be
very honest with you right now I don't
have time to brush all of my hair every
day as a matter of fact I like to just
brush the top of it and then put the
rest of it in a bun and then let go
about my day
cuz I just don't have time for all those
tangles I bleach my hair it gets really
thirsty I don't have time to wrestle
with it every day
I'd rather just reach like a compromise
and put it in the back brush the top so
that people aren't like oh I feel so bad
for that homeless girl no they're like
okay she's like shit her hair's alright
but then in the blonde it just looks
like fucking rat's nest shit in it and
then you realize they have like twigs
and leaves and stuff and there you take
it out know when you shower and all the
weird stuff that got caught your hair
comes out that just me I don't have time
for a gift like if somebody sends me a
gift and I like click on it on my phone
it's like loading and loading loading
loading I just type back ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha cuz I don't have time for that
shit it's taking too long I'm sure it's
funny do I have time to sit here all
fuckin day for a to load no why would
you waste my fucking time with this shit
or when someone sends you a gift and
then you actually do sit there and let
it load forever and it's really bad and
dumb I don't have time for that friend I
don't understand how a gift can take so
long to load an HD YouTube video loads
in like zero seconds why does this
fucking gif taking so long so most of
the time when I'm just like you
doing regular daytime stuff they don't
have like a full face of makeup on I'm
just wearing like mascara or whatever
and you know when you put the mascara on
and it just gets on your eyelid or like
blow your eye then what kind of look
you're good but I always get it just on
my eyelid and you know what I for
cleaning that shit up no like what am I
going to get a fucking q-tip in fucking
eye makeup remover and like dab it on
there like smudge it off fuck no if I
had time for that I don't have time to
do a whole fucking pole face on my face
it's sloppy for a reason because they're
not time for it and then someone's like
I got an eye mascara I'm like fuck I put
it there if you see a girl in Gia's
mascara on her face somewhere that means
she has more than like six emails in her
inbox and they're not all like shoe
deals I really do not have time when any
or all of my electronics my computer
fucking TV iPad phone everything oh
there's an update available
oh is there is there an update available
I don't want to fucking sit here while
you download it for 20 minutes and then
shut off for like five and you know
you're like had that moment of panic
like is it coming back on and then even
if you do that time for the update
you're like alright now it's a good time
for me to click on that stupid fucking
update it tells you that you need to be
connected to Wi-Fi or that you need to
be plugged into a power source fuck like
what are you what else do you need a
snack fuck you I don't and I really I
really feel comfortable saying ain't
nobody got time to flocks twice a day I
mean fuck every dentist on the planet
that tells you to floss twice a day
bitch
what is your life about you need a hobby
I would like to see some research on
people that floss twice a day versus
people that flossed once a day and what
we're talking about real significant
difference in oral health can't be that
much another thing I don't have time for
when you go to a store and you're like
oh I really like this I would like to
buy it um
it's my money and they go wow we don't
have that right now but we can certainly
order it for you and then you can come
back you know next week and pick it up
and that's when you say fuckin bye like
what why why first of all are you
selling me something that you don't have
second of all why the fuck what I want
you to order it so I can come back to
you and fucking pick it up no I would
just fuck go to my house and order
myself I don't want you to order it time
to leave time to get the fuck out of
here everyone here's the store that
doesn't sell things video shopping I
don't really like to shop in stores
anymore because it's just not time
efficient when you could just order it
on the Internet I really don't have time
for receipts you have your electronic
records and I have my electronic records
why the fuck do I need a small piece of
trash that I'm gonna lose or throw out
or at least in the back of my car to
remind me that I did something who does
they're like accounting like that I'm
gonna say if that's right thing mmhmm
yeah
and lastly something that I don't have
time for is fucking shavasana and for
those of you that don't know what
shavasana is shavasana is a pose in yoga
when you go take a yoga class do you
yoga all over the fucking room you do
your yoga and then the teacher tells you
to lay down on the ground close your
eyes
that's shavasana you do nothing but
breathe and I'm sorry for those of you
that really like your shavasana and your
yoga and they always tell you oh this is
the hardest thing for the Western yogi
to understand because you're so go-go-go
culture culture blah blah blah your
Twitter and the internet and stuff the
Western yogi doesn't know how to just be
and breathe so that's what shavasana is
I feel like shavasana is a motherfucking
waste of time you're laying on the
ground okay and if you try and get up
and leave and like skip the shavasana
like pretend that you have to go to the
bathroom or something really I don't
know cuz you're covered in your own
fucking sweat you don't feel like laying
in it oh sorry I think I'm gonna skip
shavasana today
you see good class is not over time for
shavasana is it is it bitch fuck you I'm
sorry maybe I'm not good at this whole
yoga thing because I can't win at it
like I would like it a lot better if I
could win at it but I don't have time
for fucking shavasana not now or ever
but I really do think that it makes a
funny excuse for things like if somebody
texts you and they're like hey man you
want a problem to come out today like
nah I can't I gotta shavasana tonight
sometimes I like to take a shavasana in
the afternoon but you're not gonna tell
me to shove asana marble says all the
time in the world to shavasana though
don't you
yeah it's cuz you're not a Western yogi
and your teacher doesn't insult you even
though you just paid them pebbles is
junk rose is junk Andrea Oh am i grunts
