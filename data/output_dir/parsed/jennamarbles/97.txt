you know sometimes when I make a video
I'm like who do you think would watch
this I don't know who would watch this
video but then again I don't know would
watch last week's video I've made
something really dark last week so let's
have fun this week shall we this started
because I often just browse the app
store like looking for things to have
fun with on my phone and sometimes they
come across things that just look like
ridiculous and I just want to try them
so I thought for the sake of having fun
together that I would just download as
many like cheesy and or bad looking apps
as I could find and like play them and
try them and maybe you'll find something
that you like this is not meant to be
like a app bashing video like I respect
people that make apps pour their hearts
and souls into these things I'm not
trying to tear you down but guess what
this is life sometimes we rate things on
a scale awesome too bad let's get funky
I lied though the first app that you did
actually see because I was annoying
listen earlier that's it that's the
whole app this one is worth as much as
you paid we really party too many for
this imagine if you whip out a party
touch it I think is a good app just to
have like if you're at the bank or
something and you're in line it's
getting real fucking boring this have
changed my life it sets your volume to
max amazing TV for W TV for W a pie rate
four stars because I'm turning down for
what well done I would like it to play a
little bit more of the song and I would
also like a seizure warning because I
was not ready for that
I think it's funnier now that the song
is like 2 years old
ya know it's inappropriate up for like
2016 person this one is fucking this is
horseshit this is a dog dogs grades
later just watch but but bark no no yes
so it literally just has like preset
things that it pretends is translating I
think so that's not a dog nor even
fierce predators neat ok no it reminds
me of in the jerk when that dogs barking
he's like what is it boy is it a fire
he's I brought rhymes in a fire and then
he makes everybody evacuate the better
I need to turn down for what app again
this is really pissing you just record
me usually analyze me the drug
translator app just gets it as zero like
it doesn't work it's a it's a ripoff if
I paid money for it I'm angry about it
this next app it is called soccer
imagery
I believe it's clearly made for an older
phone I think they like it well how what
gives that away it'll just give you
these stock images the Jesus documents
know this like Ryan Reynolds and Blake
Lively
and then you choices are it overlays a
soccer ball oh my god wait you lost it
it's like doing everything what oh it's
so good are you ready does it have a
front-facing camera feature this might
be too old for that what it what is
happening on the way take a pictures

incredible oh my god
Damien that's your new profile pic for
sure this is the weirdest fucking app
like what vision did this guy have when
he created this this app sucks genius
this episode I think it's great aside
from the fact that you can't upload your
own picture or take your fixture that
you have about seven choices but endless
soccer choices you can't really save it
or do anything with it I'm gonna read it
a ten out of ten
this is great app I mean the vision is

on look at the quality and the aspect
ratio of this picture like this is
clearly not stretched out wait so hold

coefficient is not no Google exists like

they took images and
meagan app this is another Waterman
