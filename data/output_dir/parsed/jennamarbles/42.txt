offense to anyone that makes apps for a
living you know I appreciate all the
work that you put into it with some are
better than others and I scoured the App
Store for the worst of the worst and
we're gonna review them we're gonna
review them thank you for that honestly

it's what everyone's been using lately

don't think that's the point of the
absolutely I'm just blowing out your
boobs you blurt out my boobs in a row
paper yes I may have enough height SiC
10 out 10 M so I found this one on the
App Store but I always couldn't believe
it but it exists you make a fake fucking
bank account so other people think that
you have like a lot of money or
something oh my god
it's literally just to show people like
your banker yeah watch two hundred
billion dollars oh wait two billion
dollars the person you trying to fool is
gonna look at it and say World Bank I
think that you can change the name of
the bank upload logo oh my god what it
took money out look at like updates
automatically yeah what is wrong with
you who is this fooling though you open
an app called fake bank account that's
bad zero zero for that app this one I
downloaded it's called catch your
cheating spouse I think and it looked
very high-tech yes please it's just like
a shop I don't know but look at this buy
our say if you ever think of cheating on
me I'm gonna get you built in four
gigabyte SD card stories Wow no comments
yet be the first to pose map a map of
what this is a black oh yes yes give me
this face yep a black light app that has
really terrible reviews hope Green says
it just doesn't work most of these I
believe by the way I had to pay money
for like 99 cents at least there is one
coming later that costs $11 it does the
middle bit hey wait hold on
a second what has maybe this is the no
it's just a broken out some balls on
this guy it costs money some fucking
balls like the reviews are literally
like why does the App Store allow this
like you're just stealing from people
this this video you've made and two
before it is a great indicator of how
poorly police the App Store is like it
you can just go on there and say that
you have an app that literally steal
money from people apparently we've all
heard of Kim og and Amber Rose moji
people have their own emojis but have
you heard of horse moji yes please don't
send me anything to copy beta you just
press me I swear to god you're gonna
spin it all the time for a whip this is
all I'm ever it's fuck I'm just trying
to imagine the conversation where these
are relevant oh look at that one and
tell me you're not a huge whore these
are I am NOT a huge course but there's
some fucking compassion okay this horse
is a made a crime hold everything
I think this horse is drinking tea horse
emoji is ten out of ten sips tea force
I'm actually gonna use this so I thought
this is gonna be a bad app but it's not
it's a girl looking at good ten out of

called let's snuggle even snuggled at
all I think you're gonna do it we got
into strawberry he talked shit to you
and you throw him straddle why can they
need this snuggle own one
alright so that's all there is I guess
this is a click baiting app I hate how
sucks
how are you gonna put snuggle in your
title and not be anything about juggling
you got creepy about this has equally
bad reviews it's just called finger scan
Oh Julian do not Julian it's a screen
there's no sensor in it it's one was it
ever grant anyone access this is the
worst fucking app it is literally one
tiny video that they replay over and
over Lee yeah that's great well I'm
pretty sure this was $0.99
you're their first customer no I'm not
because people have reviewed it this had
equally bad reviews I think you take a
picture and then it matches you with
people that look like you dude so
accurate oh my god wait why is that if
their Facebook ID in the app description
it showed pictures of like celebrities
that your face looks like not like
really like that's so violated yeah
delete that out right now

way harder than your dad your ginger so
is don't matter did nobody proofread any
of these since literally a virtual
spinner
this next one is called the sex game and
all of their abuse were like please
remove this from my phone like
apparently it was getting installed to
people's phones without the monitor they
like kids and they're like I don't want
to get in trouble for this except for
this one that says gay this game gave me
a really frustrating boat like a gay guy
threesome sex games start there's like a
flash of like some sex position and then
this that's it oh my god
what's gonna be it's all the same after
one thing is criminal because that's
like they know what they're doing they
know what they're doing and they're like
okay with it this next app costs $11 had
no real description no reviews obviously
because I don't think anyone has ever
done the only person to buy this 100%
it just says like corn dog champion or
something $11 it was ten ninety nine in
the App Store
you spent a lot of hours on that that's
like two bowls edge pulling $11 this is
$11 so bad this is criminal
this person should go to jail and give
me my $11 back the worst thing I've ever
seen I'm not sure I've ever paid $11 for
a nap that is probably the worst of the
worst of ever dress up Kelsey may slow -
she looks like a contorted dead body why
does she look like a stripper though I
have those shoes that looks like a
murder fucking scene yes look is a very
Metropolitan apartment and yet I'm
wearing an outfit that cost no more than
four dollars and I'm dead these episodes
