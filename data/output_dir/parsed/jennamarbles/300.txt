oh look it's the littlest wolf in the
wolf pack hey that's right I see your
snout Kermit hey see you know I've been
pretty open about this topic on my
Ustream in the past and with recent
events I think today might be a good day
to finally make this video what a juggle
my thoughts on marriage just FYI it's
probably not gonna be that funny you've
been warned I'm not trying to make a
political video in any way shape or form
it's not my place I don't think it's
appropriate and I usually don't disclose
my thoughts and feelings on particular
topics but for the most part what I have
to say has nothing to do with politics
it has to do with just fucking
straight-up marriage I know this is a
tricky subject because there's a lot of
cultural things and beliefs in religion
that go into how people think about
marriage and if you disagree with me
that's all really fine that's cool in
fact people have different opinions is
what makes the world go round
and all I'm trying to accomplish by
doing this is maybe just present you
with some thoughts my thoughts and you
know you can present me with your
thoughts and then we can like have a
discussion just what if I can talk about
it please just take this as my personal
opinion I respect yours if it's
different and then we can just all
fucking upload them to the internet ah
America first thing I wanna address
applies to people my age like twenties
mid 20s late 20s there's such a big
pressure on girls and guys to like hurry
up and settle down and whatever else and
I just do not feel that way every
boyfriend I've ever had I'm like look
dude if you propose to me anytime within
the next 10 years
who's got flat out saying no no thank
you I have a hard time wrapping my brain
around what your fucking hurry is 18
year olds 21 year olds getting married
why dude why and that's kind of a
rhetorical question I understand there's
lots of reasons why but the way I look
at it is your theoretically gonna be
with that person forever why do you need
to get married like now why can't you
get married when you're like 60 that's
kind of cute my aunt got married for the
first time when she was 52 that shit was
fucking awesome I water suck people that
are together for like 10 years or 15
years and they like hated you wanna
fucking get married yeah I got a couple
kids
because to me what's important is having
that commitment you don't need a ring
you don't get a dress you don't need any
of that it's all kind of like symbolic
of the commitment but you can certainly
have the commitment without all of that
and that leads me to the next thing I
want to talk about I think that many
girls in particular have really lost the
idea of what a fucking marriage is about
it's not about fucking flowers in your
ring and your dress and your hair and
your makeup and your fucking everything
it's about the person that you love that
you're making a commitment to and the
fact that your friends and family are
there to be witnessed and celebrate and
be fucking happy that's it you want to
spend all your money on your wedding
that's fine but what I do have a problem
with is when people fucking spend all
this money on a wedding that they don't
have oh man I don't have a job and I'm
collecting unemployment you know what I
should fucking do throw a giant wedding
what the fuck you having a wedding is
gonna throw you into debt and you want
to be with this person forever why can't
you just wait a few years until you can
afford it and a lot of people have
parents that want to pay for their
wedding and that's cool but that doesn't
mean that you should just fuck and do it
just because someone's paying for my
parents can afford to buy me a cookie
the size of my room does that mean I
should eat it nah dude I get fucking
sick and again
just my opinion I don't know how many of
you have like sat down had a real
conversation with your parents who's
paying for your wedding all once has
this ever come up as a topic of
conversation I don't think I would ever
want someone to pay for my wedding or
part of my wedding fuck that noise I
think if it's my choice of who I get to
marry and when I get to get married and
what I want everything to be like I can
fucking pay for it if I want to all you
got a do show up
I got fucking open back that's what it's
got my money on told you ladies out
there and you should calm the fuck down
because you don't have to get married
you don't need a big fucking fairytale
wedding you don't need to get married
when you're in your 20s you don't even
have a fucking baby now you don't need
you don't even do any of that you can
make your own choices
and live your own life and anyone that
has a problem with that you can just go
ahead and point to your own brain and be
like this year's no okay then shut the
fuck up now I want to talk about sack
down give a shit about gay marriage
not they don't give shit about it but
that if you want to marry someone that
you love I don't fucking care that's
awesome
go for it I don't care if you want to
marry a penguin I don't care if you want
to marry a box of fucking fruit roll-ups
and it just seems kind of silly to me
that people are like so wrapped up and
that other people can't marry other
people what in the fuck do you care what
people are doing with their genitals
almost every person I know has a gay
friend or gay relative or even someone
on TV or in movies that's gay that they
like that they're like dude why can't
they just get fucking married I don't
understand and there's not a lot of time
so you're gonna hear me talk about
things like this because I like things
who light-hearted and fun and I don't
ever want to isolate someone because of
their beliefs but I was planning on
making this video about marriage and how
is it fair that I'm allowed to have all
these thoughts and feelings all when I
want to get married or if I do or what
it's what's gonna happen and this plenty
of people that don't ever get to have a
choice just seems fucking wrong main
reason I just wanted to make this video
is because I think that you should be
able to make your own thoughts and
choices about marriage and that that
should apply to everyone regardless of
sexual orientation and that disclosing
some of my ideas maybe might just take a
little bit of pressure off for you and
be like you know what I don't have to do
what everyone else is doing or what
society tells me to do I get it whatever
the fuck I want okay McCrone up make
