is that a ghost no it's just really
messy dirty here so something I get
asked a lot is tell us about your most
embarrassing moments and unfortunately I
really don't have any like big giant
like life-altering embarrassing moments
part of me wishes that I did gonna have
good stories to tell but you guys ask
all the time tell us all the weird off
things that happen to you so that we can
laugh at you guys are dicks and it's
also it's hard me to remember times and
I was embarrassed because I'm not easily
embarrassed because I just give zero
fucks but gather round children I'm
gonna tell you some stories I think
these are gonna go in chronological
order - all right first embarrassing
moment was it daycare and there's this
kid there I don't know his name but he
was a shitbag he was always getting in
trouble he was always like in in fights
with people and I would always just stay
away from him cuz I'm like I'm really
scared of you and I was kind of a shy
kid anyways but one day he decided to
punch me square in my stomach
and it knocked the wind out of me so I
was little you're like 5 or 6 or
whatever and not only did he punch me
square in my stomach
then he pinched me except I wasn't
wearing piss I was wearing like a onesie
romper like jumper shorts and you like
tie up on your neck so he pull it so
hard
pick up this but ask naked in front of
everyone which I know isn't that big of
a deal when you're like 5 but I was
mortified I was I couldn't breathe I
didn't do anything
why today do I like I wasn't even
talking to him nothing I just got my day
lit the fuck up now I'm naked excuse me
can I go home now I mean no matter what
way you cut that up getting pantsed in a
onesie jumper it's just an embarrassing
time second embarrassing story so when I
was in fourth grade there was a kid he
had an epic crush on me I mean so epic
he had this advanced technology when I
was in fourth grade that was like a
printer and a scanner which nobody
fucking had you know when you get your
like class
picture everybody's standing and like
here a little sweater like so awkward he
took our class picture he blew it up he
zooms in on my face and just put my face
in his locker like this kid had such a
big crush on me which was bizarre
because nobody had a crush on me I
looked like a boy band child that looked
like a little tomboy and I was like
covered in dirt like if I would go swing
the swings dad he was like sit under
like a jungle gym with his little like
cereal box binoculars and spy on me
everyone was well aware that this kid
had a crush on me it made me feel weird
we had a talent show and it wasn't like
school-wide it was just in our class
we're like 20-something kids we put our
desks like we moved them all in a circle
we're like getting all pumped all
excited we're gonna do some weird shit
and when it was this kids turn
he doesn't even stand in the middle of
the circle he walks directly up to in
front of my desk and he's saying the
entire song Breakfast at Tiffany's
the one that's like innocent what about
Breakfast at Tiffany's he sang the whole
song without breaking eye contact with
me and weirdest fucking thing in the
world and was so on
fairest was a funk you guys fuck all of
you fuck you fuck you fuck you so funny
and he did it like dead face and then
after he was done he went into the
middle of the circle he did a couple
karate moves and then he sat down at his
desk
what the fuck and to this day I cannot
listen to that song I hate that fucking
song it was so fucking weirdo so
embarrassed mmm my favorite alright next
story I was maybe 13 years old I went to
an all-girls summer camp at wells
College I had a great time you wouldn't
think you'd have a great time at an
all-girls College when you're 13 you're
like boys boys boys boys boys and so one
day we were riding bikes and there's
giant hail it's like in the Finger Lakes
kind of for those who neither don't know
it's like lots of pretty lakes and hills
grass and farms and cows we spill
murders like me
ten of us we're riding bikes and we give
to this giant hill I'm like oh man
that's gonna be awesome we're gonna ride
down this hill at this biggest gigantic
it's not only steep it's also very very
very malt so you're going to be going
down the hill for a long time it's not
like the first time I've ever ridden a
bike like 13 this point I'm going it
expert okay and riding my bike down this
fucking Hill and all of a sudden I like
see the squirrel a little ways in front
of me and he starts hopping out oh hey
miss Clara look at me just minding my
own business looking for acorns and then
all of a sudden I'm like oh my god he's
not moving he's not moving he's like
right in front of me and everybody's
like behind me I'm like whipping it down
this hill like a give a fuck and I'm
like oh my god I don't know what to do
and the hill is so steep that if I like
slam on the brakes or try and swerve all
the way I run the risk of just wiping
out and breaking every bone in my body
so I'm just hoping and praying I'm like
screaming like he's moving and as I get
closer and closer I'm like gigs going so
fast he starts doing that light doesn't
know which way to go so it just freaks
out it does that my bike just like
racing first world impact and I run him
over right in the middle I ran over a
squirrel on a bike so that's not really
embarrassing but what was embarrassing
it's I keep going down the hill and as
I'm going down I can't look back cuz I'm
gonna die if I do so I just start
bawling my eyes I'm crying riding my
bike I finally get to the bottom of the
hill and everybody else comes behind me
Oh me and you see that squirrel bag
there's like good bass like somebody ran
over it was wild he was like jerking all
around and I was like damn my bike on
the ground it is so crying my eyes out
and they were ripping on me forever they
just thought it was the funniest fucking
thing a that I ran a worst girl on my
bike which I'm pretty sure is
mathematically almost impossible and be
that I was like absolutely heartbroken
that I had just murdered a squirrel via
bicycle and
still a sore fucking topic so don't
bring it up all right
telling you this in confidence all right
so my next embarrassing story involves
my high school senior yearbook I didn't
realize how embarrassing this was until
after it happened and then I was like oh
so they're like 400 people in my class
at the end of your senior year we vote
on superlatives and obviously there's
too many people in a class for everybody
get a superlative so if you got a
president that was like oh sweet that's
cool I have mentioned before I had a
boyfriend for all four years of high
school my high school superlatives are
400 fucking people biggest flirt
that's fucking embarrassing I got voted
biggest flirt and I had a serious
four-year relationship for all of that
I'm either an asshole or I'm just
excellent at flirting
I think I'm excellent flirting the next
sorry I think I was 21 years old I was
working at a camp horses the office lady
and his kid had come in to like do
maintenance or something he was like
really really hot I had to like take him
on a tour around the camp and whatever
and I had like some makeup on picked an
obviously cousin Jana
so it was like blazing hot out and like
really you it and I'm totally talking to
them he's like you know being really
friendly to me and then yeah
see you later thanks thanks for
everything bye hope to see you again
really you left and I went to go get in
my car and I look in the mirror and I
had sweat myself a reverse mustache
through my makeup and fake tan like it
was not subtle it was like white white
white white white white and all are some
makeup but in like a little go my
forehead but just like this blainley
obvious reverse mustache it sucked
and I never saw that kid again and he
certainly did not ask me for my phone
number or try and talk to me in any
other way because he's all set with
fucking white mustache girl and lastly I
think my lecture near senior year of
college when we were in softball season
you know we can't like drink within 48
hours of the game of practice so you
basically can't drink like ever and if
you did a weekend that you can just
fuckin girl age it it was like st.
Patrick's Day you know we just got back
from spring training I wound up getting
kicked out of the bar and I was just
getting really drunk a lot of hands I'm
pretty sure that I kissed the guy in the
cheek so that I could wear his hat next
thing I know I'm playing with my back on
the dance floor looking up at all the
legs like whoa what is happening and all
of a sudden someone's face comes over me
like you you're right here I was like no
I'm dancing I'm just doing it from down
here I got the fucking boot I got booted
out of there and then also later my
boyfriend at the time he came over and
found me in my underwear and long-sleeve
shirt curled up in a ball underneath my
desk
listening to laboux Sh on blast that's
where I'm fell asleep so I have been
kicked out of a bar pretty embarrassing
