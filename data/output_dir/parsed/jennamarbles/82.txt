yeah what what are you gonna do more
firm case you didn't tell I've been
watching a lot of beauty videos lately
especially if you follow me on snapchat
you know that I was watching something
called Polish Mountain which is a
hundred coats of nail polish or 200
coats of gel polish or whatever the fuck
and I was like this is the internet that
I signed up for and then I went down
that rabbit hole ten out of ten would
recommend by the way and there's a
hundred coats of foundation hundred
coats of mascara 100 coats of liquid
lipstick so I was like I want to do this
but I want to do it hard as fuck since
day one I did not come here to play
games
if I'm gonna do a beauty video it's
going to be the epicMealTime of beauty
videos so I picked some of these to do
but I also added some ones that I
haven't seen anyone do because I want to
put them all together and do them to
myself and make this the ultimate 100
coats video this is not sponsored by any
of these products obviously but I will
tell you what I'm using I'm not positive
that all of these are going to work so
I'm going to do a hundred coats of
liquid lipstick I'm going to do a
hundred coats of foundation is there NYX
this is Smashbox 15 hour where fuck me
up 100 coats of glitter nail polish
which might get soured by the fact that
I'm also doing a hundred coats of spray
tan on the same arm and I'm going to do
a hundred coats of hairspray and last
but now please why do a hundred coats of
mascara when you could do a hundred
pairs of things to clarify I didn't
think mathematically that a hundred
pairs of lashes would fit on your eye
but I'm gonna be doing fifty pairs so
100 total lashes I know this video is
gonna take a long time to make I'm here
I'm ready I'm literally sitting on a
tarp this couch will be ruined there's
towels then this all of this is gonna be
fucked so I mean just know what I'm
giving up to have a great time on the
Internet today everyone please just in
your heart say a prayer for my skin in
my lips in my arm I'm a Beauty Blender
we're all gonna die today
this is coat number one you're scared
for me I'm turning back now
oh my god I think we all know instantly
why no one has done that before this is
a terrible idea
I think I'm going to paint just like my
last three fingers know that I will need
my left pointer finger to put on my
lashes so five any eyelashes after this
I'm gonna be shocked absolutely shocked
literally took five minutes for one
round that rate it's going to take 500
minutes how many hours is that almost
ten ten hours my face feels gross gross
you nasty alright so I just finished
coat number ten in case you were
wondering I'm probably not gonna record
every single step of this because
there's so many things happening and
just be such a long video of me just
doing this I promise you on my life I am
not skipping any steps I think you'll be
able to tell this is only ten lashes I
have 4d to go I'm sort of just like
putting it out there and doing the best
that I can but so far it feels like a
bush or like a caterpillar and my arm is
very shiny my nails aren't quite
mountains yet but that's only ten layers
it's a P what am I gonna do how am I
gonna pee with this okay just checking
in I'm on level 21 right now this is a
very time-consuming process the longest
of which is these lips and this fix I
don't feel like anyone's showed how much
of this actually gets on your teeth I
take they're covered it's disgusting the
lips are taking really long the rest of
it is okay I mean my lashes look great
and feel like a tiny mammal on my eyes
here you bring in nice and close girl
hey I think my nails are going pretty
well my spray tan is absolutely
disgusting a bug flew into it and killed
itself on it a bug literally kamikaze
into my arm
if your arm looks
hot dog yeah it looks delicious don't
squish it
here comes layer 25 so it's gotten to
the point where I don't really know
where to put these I've just been like
flipping them up and then jamming it and
I don't even know where they go when
they go there about this thick right now
like this thick oh yeah
there he go have you noticed that my
foundation is getting into my lashes too
I think it adds to the whole look it's
really it's good look I like it
Julien yes this might be the day that my
too much Jean really is too much I can't
understand what emotion you're promoting
right now at all I can't mo Julien I
look great I just wanted to show you
something
stop it this is 26 I feel like Tiffany
Pollard I need an adult this is your
face this is your face on drugs
someone's then help for me Oh No is it
just me or is it getting beautiful yeah
it also just occurred to me that all of
my hair might break off from these
hundred coats of hairspray I have no
idea what happens when you put that much
hairspray in your hair like is my hair
gonna fall out that would suck it
wouldn't be worth it at all I'm on lash
44 right now this is starting to burn a
little because I think this might be
dangerous I'm gonna do this for five
hours I have six steps and it's taking a
long time but this is my very last set
of lashes which means that I am now put
on fifty lashes on each eye and a
hundred lashes all together once I get
this one on and it marks the halfway
point for the rest of my things but the
reason why I'm not treating it like
totally so you can see every layer every
step that's left so cuz I feel like it's
no fun I want to see the surprise I end
up fast-forwarding the video anyways so
I'll just make this video the way that I
want to watch it you know just cut to
the good part man Oh 100 lashes where
where where that is what 50 of the same
eyelash on the Steve looks like in a
hundred total lashes mmm girl let me
take this opportunity to just squish
them down a little you see how thick and
luscious and I did not cheat at all I
did not stack them at any point I glued
them all on individually furry little
shelf it feels like Kermit close your
eyes tell me that doesn't feel like
Kermit
it feels so course just like curving
this is the update on my nails I think
they're coming along beautifully and
this is the worst decision I've ever
made in my life
Julien how am I looking so far it looks
it looks terrible I hate everything
about it and
scared for the fact that this is only
technique your hair looks like it's
gonna break don't don't
I can't like if I look down and then
look up I can't open my eyes so creepy
this is now how I am keeping track by
putting dots on these and going insane
the entire time
I mean a lot of my soul is dead but this
is coat number 60 I look just like
fucking Janice that's Janice Jenna
you look like you cut Jenna's face off
and are wearing it as a face well so
what if I did it's a good thing my nails
are looking sleepy I just hit 80 feeling
fabulous there's like a clear separation
from where the foundation is in your
real skin fuck you talking oh I look to
the side this is my hair yeah
like look like this do you see it in
your jawline I think it looks natural
swept his hair tied chillin with no
makeup on that's why I'm the prettiest I
know I'm having a hard time with this
liquid lipstick now the were this far in
it like really refuses to dry no matter
what I do so I'm just doing my best so I
hope you can bear with me I still got
that Kylie lip kit so I had to do with
this and it's soapy you're just er no
you're disturbing
can I just take a break for a second and
say that I swear on my life that I'm not
trying to be problematic at all
I just really genuinely wanted to do
this as an experiment I know that
there's someone out there that just
feels deeply offended but please note
that this only came from a place of pure
curiosity do I look like someone that
wants the hurt your feelings cologne ah
so I've made it to 90 layers and I'm
just I'm praying that I can pull this
out and finish it in so many hours I'm
so hungry I'm just gonna fucking head
down all business ten more I can do it
it's the last coat it's the last coat
foundation done polish Mountain done 100
coats of hairspray done I fucking did it
I am officially done with this look for
anyone that's wondering what a hundred
coats of spray tan looks like it looks
like this okay and it's the first thing
I'm gonna do is wash this off because
this just looks intensely wrong so I
will be right back there's so much
better anyways so this is what my 100
coats of nail polish looks like a
mediocre polish Mountain I would say but
I did my best I mean they're not really
mountains they're just like little
snowballs they're my favorite part of
this by far really
why because I hate everything else with
a fury I will say a hundred coats of
hairspray I mean it feels like I just
covered my hair and glue but it's not
the worst thing I thought it would be
way more like brittle it literally just
feels like I put nail polish in my hair
yeah actually I would argue that it is
the worst it's the worst sort the worst
worse than this like I don't think I
would wish this experience on anyone
ever I don't know why I did this to
myself it just feels so wrong my face at
this point feels like I'm not sure if it
could ever feel clean again you know
what I'm saying
that's how just guessing a few I'm
really impressed with 50
lashes although they did get a fair
amount of hairspray and I think that's
easily the most impressive part really
yeah I think it feels so good but they
feel like little fucking little hamster
yeah don't do that stop it if you feel
like little hamsters on my eyes I really
like them I just don't know how I'm
gonna get them off without ripping on my
eyelashes I give this like a 10 out of
10 I think I'm a natural beauty this
looks great and you fucking know it
see this stuff like this is like a rogue
hair that got caught in my foundation 50
layers or 50 layers ago
that's nasty it's so sticky do you know
how many layers of like accidental
liquid lipstick under this there are and
then the foundation just like covered in
bullshit girl
it worked it wasn't as painful as I
thought it was gonna be look I might
still have some lapu this is the look
though PG you want dance we're not
getting away from my dog this is what my
50 lashes look like ya know I'm
surprised I still have any eyelashes I'm
fuckin pumped right now I look like a
man defi oh my god holy shit it looks
like you just gassed yourself Wow
it's never gonna come off I mean nude
eyebrows are a good look I kind of like
this I regret everything I want to take
this whole day back oh no you seven and
a half hours for very mediocre payoff
I'd say and just a very wrong looking
arm but you know I did it I gave it my
all
I saw you beauty community and then I
raised you five other hundred coats of
things it's just like spreading it all
over your face how'd they like this
video I will never ever ever ever do
anything like this again I don't know
how I'm gonna fix my life it's
permanently ruined
and make sure you subscribe to my
channel I thought of interviews every
Wednesday we're never doing this again
and we're never talking about it again
either when you go to bed site just say
it like a prayer for my skin every
appreciate something fucking funny yes
