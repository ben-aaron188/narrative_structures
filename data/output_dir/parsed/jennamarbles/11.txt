yes whose man is at a town beach it's
mad you shall learn his lesson the first
time he left me last time I dyed my own
hairs probably about like five months
ago I dyed it bright red I have not
touched it since then - the fact that I
did a perm on it don't get me wrong like
I'm really feeling this like rose gold
color but like it's time I'm not one of
these youtubers that like it's a bunch
of shit for free I'm not a beauty guru
I'm not a youtuber huge missed
opportunity by the way and not calling
yourselves you tubers what are you guys
doing but Sally Beauty a couple weeks
ago found my address
I don't know how bitch I'm hidden and
sent me like a box full of shampoos
conditioners and nail stuff and
something like really nice-looking hair
color okay and I'm like that's going on
my head
I feel like I'm going on this journey I
don't think I've had professional touch
my hair since the very beginning of 2017
like January it's gonna be about a year
soon since anyone qualified has touched
my hair you know what I feel like it's
looking better than ever it's getting
some length yeah it might feel bad
because I fucking damaged it but like
I'm really having a great time only
doing my own hair so this is like a
semi-permanent sapphire they sent me a
permanent black cherry color I listened
to one person talk on the internet and
they said permanent hair color is the
one that you know sort of like lifts and
might damage your hair but like a
semi-permanent it's like not really a
commitment like it's gonna wash out like
maybe it doesn't really penetrate all of
your hair I don't know maybe you can
research that in your own but I don't
really care it's just like the time I
got my first set only tattoo like 10
years ago
it's my mom's the brothers initials and
they were like you don't want that light
pink color it might fade and I was like
that sounds fucking great let it fade
bitch what if our family does fucked up
shit let it fade okay it's like a low
commitment tattoo all I know is that I
feel like I've only dyed my hair
permanent colors I've never delved into
this world of semi-permanent because if
this is truly semi-permanent I can do
this shit whenever the fuck I want I
only watch one person talk about it
that's enough for me because guess who
doesn't give a fuck about their hair me
bitch and I feel like it's going great
maybe that's a sign that today's
go back let's surprise that man when he
gets home with a beautiful sapphire hair
and I looked up the swatches of this
color online and it looks like a like a
navy blue almost and I also don't know
how this is gonna work since I have like
part of this was bleached in the past
this is my natural color there's clearly
some red still here I don't know but
guess what it's not a permanent color is
this a permanent color that means it
gonna be okay right does this part feel
like Doritos yeah it does but you know
what it's all part of the journey I'm
just gonna see how far I can take this
without having a hairdresser touch my
hair and yes I have seen the videos of a
hairdresser reacting to me doing my hair
and you know what even he thinks they're
great I'm great technique I'm a born
natural bitch this doesn't even require
a developer I'm just gonna dump this on
my head and if you're one of those
people that's too scared to dye your
hair just live vicariously through me
okay I'll do anything for my Sally
beauty also sent me this guess what this
says Coleman gloves see it's a thing all
you here dresses out there cringing at
me when I'm just using my gloves to
shampoo the color around or whatever
it's a thing look instead of wearing
like a dumpy shirt that I don't care
about I just figured I'll wear my
favorite shirt so then it forces me to
be like more careful that makes sense
right good god this is dark we making a
semi commitment right now
fuck it y'all let's go to the dogs I
hope that it like it comes out shiny and
pretty because right now my hair almost
absorbs light it's the antithesis of
shine it looks like if you take a
flashlight and like show it on a cheeto
this sectioning is a pipe dream all
right are you ready if this is going
well which it already is maybe I throw
some of this in my fucking eyebrows when
I shave them I feel like they grow back
within the month but when I bleached my
eyebrows they are still so making it
work
they are still so bleached oh listen to
that
doesn't that sound like hair care at its
finest Oh bitch I look like a superhero
I've made myself a nice hot mess here
it's worse and worse I think this is the
darkest my hair has ever been I was
serious about that youtuber thing I like
now I am only gonna refer to myself as a
view tuber you guys slept on that word
you didn't think of it it's not my brand
guys I'm a youtuber see look I feel like
the black shirt was a great plan sure to
section my hair how do we do this to me
look at all this blonde in here this
color is pretty natural look at my eyes
tell me this color is that her you know
all the blue marks this sounds like when
you stir a bowl of macaroni can you hear
my hair just dying watch I go to just
like shower and all my hair just falls
out oh I don't know how long this stays
on for well do like 40 minutes I feel
like that's a good measure of time right
like every hair color is like 40 minutes
yeah I think that's right like you know
how you sometimes when you go to a salon
and you sit under like a hair dryer what
if you just do this enough and it's like
the friction creates the heat and it
does the same thing oh I feel like it's
making my light skin look nice then I
don't have to feel so bad about being a
person that literally never goes outside
because now I have a hair color that
complements that like last year I was so
vitamin D deficient I got prescribed a
vitamin D pill that I only had to take
once a week all you people that joke
about not going outside not getting
enough Sun trying to bitch click five
dollars so like two things is like ten
dollars this is definitely ten dollars
worth of fun are you kidding me let me
show you really put it so yes the
outside of my brow is shaved I like to
shave them sometimes you know this by
now oh how did this happen
why do we even bother wearing clothes
whatever so usually I feel like people
like take a clean bully and like do it
no leave it on there for like two
seconds okay yeah I'll take a spoolie
that's on the other side of a brow
pencil and I'm just gonna brush it in
there I feel like it's looking better
already
see how bleach that is still how long
ago is that if we're just gonna run to
the grocery store real quick I'm going
hold out and let me pencil in my brows I
don't want to scare any children fuck
with me I'm a blue net I'm excited to
see just how semi-permanent this is tell
me I'm wrong here but this doesn't look
like the kind of color that's just gonna
wash out real quick you know what it's
definitely like a subtle change like not
traumatic not drastic at all it's just
like a nice subtle winter change I mean
forget about a towel for my shoulders
what the fuck I am second-guessing my
method look at all these spots IMed yeah
but like scalp coverage 10 out of 10 I'm
just kidding you know it's a Dyer scale
I'm gonna try taking my brows off I mean
didn't really work maybe I should leave
it a little longer give me your honest
opinion what do you think yes I'll let
these sit a little longer look at my ear
oh yeah everything off my brow is the
more inked out my hair and see how he
did just a nice subtle blue eyebrow
never hurt anybody I didn't just want
this color on my hair I wanted it all
over my face and body and neck I'm going
to go rinse out my hair I'm very excited
let's do it okay I feel like there's
still a lot of color in it seven
epartment in it is kind of the jam right
now I can definitely see where it like
didn't really take in my roots which is
fine really doesn't feel that bad feels
kind of fine it also doesn't burn
anywhere like this is kind of fucking
rad right I'm gonna dry my hair and then
we can just do a nice little cut you
know professional little cut I don't
know what I'm gonna do yet but we'll see
what the color looks like and then
figure it out so I'm just gonna do some
nice hot heat on it to keep it healthy
you know
oh my god this is amazing
it feels great the color is great
especially like on this side and like
down here but like over here I
definitely have this like I dyed my hair
by myself at home alone and you know
there's like a little red and they're
still like there's some there's some
weird shit going on in there but overall
bitch I like it a lot it's dark it's fun
I look like a superhero it's diamond-cut
if there's anything that I learned from
the last time I cut my bangs it's like
don't even bother with all this extra
shit all this partying shit like just
fucking get in there and do it when I
was a young boy my father don't mean to
the city oh shit and we're done
should I like tie a string around this
and hang it on my Christmas tree oh do
people like razor cut their hair what if
I got my razor and did it it's gonna get
all the benefits of this shea butter and
stuff after the scissors it is well
twisty little choppy oh yeah I'm looking
like a flying blue mop bitch like I feel
like I've just been chopping like this
for so long and they're still not
looking regular Oh Edward fucking this
is a hand they're like a nice blunt side
bang oh no see how it's like longer in
the front and then it gets shorter hmm I
have to work on that should I just go
full Bank should I do it type in the
comments now my worry is that if I go
like folding that it's just gonna be way
too much fun
we'll do a ton of this so that it comes
out looking regular get like I'm trying
to do the most efficient thing you know
and the most efficient thing is just
cutting them straight across to do all
this oh girl look at that look like my
mom in like 1960 bitch I promise you you
do not have to be concerned about me
okay I'm in a good place in life just
because I now have little mini bangs
does that mean that I'm out of control
look bitch I am an anime character let's
keep going you guys give me like an
anime name I'm trying to get to the
point in life where someday when my kids
see pictures and videos of me they're
like who the fuck is that talking about
so I think Julian's about to be home in
like ten or so minutes so I'm just gonna
like keep back act like nothing happened
everything's normal welcome home does
this look natural yeah yeah but it's
like my life now there's something to
show you though yeah this might be one
of my favorite looks because it's so
different than anything you've done
right yeah it's like really dark and
it's like the way you're wearing is like
very cute yeah hey future with some bang
beats it's it's not permanent color it's
only semi-permanent so it might not I
don't really know
it sounds less permanent though what'd
you think did it no it's not it's I
really made sure to not make the same
mistake as the red it's not everywhere
there's not hair everywhere it's true
you believe me oh look you you look so
fucking cute semi permanent so that's
like I don't know what that means I
don't know either but like there's no
semi your hair's either died or it's
regular it's this semi-permanent I feel
like this is low commitment no it's not
that's an excuse you're a neighbor to
yourself it's really cool it's like I've
really always loved so you see how
though it's like not super dry and
damaged cuz it's not an ammonia like
permanent color so I didn't like destroy
my hair like it's not gonna fall out of
my head this is all still like pretty
much my natural color it looks like
shiny and healthy and smells good which
is the change for me it doesn't smell
like burnt hair it smells really good
