whoa let me show you what's happening
right now take a break for a second it
was Marvel's fourth birthday yesterday
happy birthday Babu and quick update I
went to another hand doctor and he said
I can wear this splint and somebody tape
instead of a cast since I didn't like
break my hand in half so now I can take
this off occasionally and wash my hands
holy shit but it's so broken I still
need to wear this for like another month
but this is way better than that weird
district nine hand thing I had going on
before I thickest but I want to talk
about today is how to make games more
fun pretty sure I've referenced in more
than one video that my friends that I'd
like to play sorry a lot not really
because sorry is the best game ever it's
because we've made it the best game ever
I have a problem with rules as it is and
following them so what I do is I just
make up my own rules and I encourage you
to do the same now aside from sorry and
I will tell you how we change sorry to
be much more fun and not just a drinking
game I've looked at the other games in
my house as well and I've come up with
some things that you can do to make them
way more fun I didn't go through every
game ever invented so if you have
different games at your house put your
little creativity hat on and fucking
make up rules to everything so I hope
this inspires you to be like oh these
are your rules they're not mine fuck
yourself I'll play this game how about
wha oh okay oh my earring my earring
doesn't follow rules either so for sorry
we took some of Max's old business cards
sat around how to power out and came up
with awesome rules so I make it so when
you draw the cards like you're drawing
the number sometimes you'll get a real
number and other times you have no idea
what you're gonna some of them are
functional move upon of yours including
from start to go to any slide on the
board and GUI
some are purely to make each other laugh
this rule is called the menage tois move
any two pieces not your own on opposite
sides of your pond so that you make like
a little train gangbang sandwich and
then we have rules that just make no
fucking sense this rule is called the
drunken pond place one pond on its side
this pond must move backwards
reset that pond goes back to start so
basically your pond is just a drunk ass
motherfucker wandering around the sorry
board and you can sorry people but you
can never go home because your drunk is
fucking cannot find your way the only
way to get I'm drunk is the
sorry ridiculous so that's just an
example of what we've done with sorry
and we have like 30 rules like that
every person that comes in plays they
have to write a new rule it's just
awesome next game I wanna talk about is
monopoly first of all no one ever wants
to play Monopoly with me cuz it always
takes like three hours you always end up
like negotiating with somebody and doing
something stupid so what I thought of is
why not make it way more interactive
than that say you don't have enough
money to buy boardwalk what can you do
you have to go on Facebook and like two
of your ex-boyfriends pictures or write
a comment on his wall say you land on
someone else's property and can't pay
for it you have to tweet six times at
Justin Bieber how much you love him and
don't explain it to anyone on Twitter
you have three railroads and I have the
fourth and you want mine
okay you have to change your Twitter
name too I like to suck dicks you pass
go you have to find someone on Facebook
that you're deliberately not friends
with say you land on free parking you
have to post a very unflattering picture
of you on Instagram say you league on
luxury tax and don't want to pay it you
have to change your Facebook and Twitter
picture to a picture of One Direction
say you're in jail and can't get out you
have to friend your ex-boyfriends new
girlfriend on Facebook or your parents
time game's over
no one's really won or lost you've all
just thoroughly embarrassed yourselves
it's like a fear factor monopoly of the
internet hilarious
next board game I want to talk about is
clue and before I do let's just slow it
down for one second clue is a game about
murder like doctor we're playing clue
and your kidney like yes so fun gonna
figure out who murdered this other
person what they get it and now that I'm
old I'm kind of just like this isn't fun
like what the fuck is Colonel Mustard
and why is he in the study murdering
someone with a rope so we want to think
of a way to make a little bit more
relevant you know more exciting it all
you gotta do is just change the room
names the murderers and the weapons and
boom you have our fucking killer game
pun intended if you just did those
things your answers at the end of the
game would look something like this it
was Michael Jackson's doctor in a white
Bronco with bath salts jaws with a
drive-by in Whitney Houston's hotel room
scar from The Lion King with a tsunami
outside of John Lennon's apartment
Charles Manson with
Dorothy's house in Jurassic Park
Voldemort with an Armageddon asteroid in
Abraham Lincoln's theater balcony
Hannibal Lecter with sharks with laser
beams attached to their heads in The
Hunger Games Godzilla with the twister
in North Korea
Bambi's hunter with Tony Montana's
little friend on the Titanic Casey
Anthony with snakes on a plane in the
Temple of Doom Hitler with a lightsaber
in a covered wagon on the Oregon Trail
you see how much more fun that is tell
me you wouldn't want to play that game
then lastly I want to talk about
drinking games because you can pretty
much turn anything that you do in life
into a drinking game my personal
favorite just so happens to be the law
and order SVU drinking game I'll put the
link down in the description but there's
one drink again that I want to share
with you because it's so awesome someone
said to me recently
it's the jenna Marbles drinking game but
it goes a little something like this
rule number one is drink every time I
refer to current as something other than
Kermit like a silver unicorn or mr.
Burnes
rule number two is drink every time I
swear fuck rule number three is drink
every time I say bye spider-man fuck
every video that I wear my key necklace
drink every time I randomly say the word
vagina drink every time I say to myself
or my dog's drink every time you see my
ninja turtle backpack drink mmm every
time I say we drink every time I dress
up at a moustache drink and lastly every
time you hear the squeaky noise in the
beginning my videos drink it's a pretty
sick game and there's what I say thank
you to whoever did that this is pretty
awesome only other thing I want to say
about making games more fun is that I
was recently introduced to a thing
called the troll rule in beer pong which
is my favorite game in the troll rule is
if you don't hit any cups in a game you
have to sit under the table and people
are allowed to like put drinks under
there for you to drink and like splash
you and I don't know just treat you like
a troll so I would say a fail-proof way
of turning any game that you're playing
into a more fun game is to incorporate
somehow the troll rule hilarious the
gussa
so next time you find yourself hanging
out at home with some friends bust out
your board games put your little heads
together and come up with some fucking
awesome games make sure you subscribe to

family we love each other did it yeah do
