here's the thing stay with me for one
second my boyfriend and I have a podcast
called the Jenna and Julian podcast and
I realized that Julian is terrible at
celebrity trivia he has no idea who
anyone is one of the questions I asked
him was about Cher by the way he thinks
that Cher Shakira and Celine Dion all
had the same voice he also thinks that
Anne Hathaway Julia Roberts and Sandra
Bullock are the same person but he
literally said to me I know who share is
she's from the movie stuck on you then
he went on to relentlessly make fun of
me because I had never seen the movie
stuck on you because it's trash and
garbage and why would I have ever seen
it so we watched it recently and yet
they're just two people stuck together
it's a trash movie and he thinks it's
like a cinematic masterpiece it did get
me thinking though like to be stuck to
another person hmm but for dogs to be
stuck to each other Oh Mike I'm gonna
make stuck on you for dogs and I know
you've seen the title of this video and
you're thinking but you only have three
dogs wrong this is my mom's dog her name
is Gil Dee which our mom is convinced
means like celebration or something like
Norwegian which I think she just made up
for dogs I want to make a quadruple dog
sweater now I look for it on the
internet it doesn't exist
probably for a good reason because it
seems kind of wrong but maybe that's my
purpose in life is to just have dogs
with me and this is like their purgatory
or like version of Hell you're sentenced
to life living in my house where I do
things out of love but that are
questionable but like love you way too
much I also realized that I've been
doing a lot of crafting and DIY videos
guess what
watch out kids because when you turn 30
all you're going to want to do is craft
I feel like the only way for me to
properly express my emotions is to just
sit down and do something very tactile
which includes laughter which means I'm
going to be making a quadruple dog
sweater today welcome to my channel so I
got to thinking how am I going to do
this I want to do it all the way out and
not in a practical way like they're not
going to be able to go to the bathroom
in this this is like a five-minute
wearing thing and then you have to take
it off though they're not going to
really be able to do anything but I want
it to exist like the Human Centipede for
dogs but they're not all facing
direction they're all facing the same
way are you on board with me so if you
make like a sack and then you tie them
all in it and cut holes for the stay
with me their head and their arms and
their tip then you can have a quad dog
like sweater thing this is minion fleece
which I felt was appropriate but then I
was like what if there's not enough
given here you know marbles is a lot
smaller than the rest of them so I also
got a stretch fabric in galaxy because
this is the Internet then I also have a
last resort gym hoping I don't have to
get to will get there when we get there
but here we go I'm going to attempt for
the first time that I'm aware of on the
internet quadruple dog sweater say a
prayer for my dogs
I'm so sorry please forgive me they are
so tolerant of my fucking bullshit right
here we go alright so don't worry
I got three yards of minion fabric so
there'll probably be some left over if
you'd like to buy it from me on my
personal Etsy it's called why am I like
this
Etsy calm slash gmail 100 it's an email
address what are you doing
this is gonna be a disaster guys there
are scissors here
Kichi girl I'm gonna have to get them
all in here somehow good luck Yuja car
meet mama everyone come and sit nicely
the line yeah right oh we're like
sisters we have the same mother right
sit oh jeez are you oh good
Kermit Kermit knows how this goes right
maybe you like words more the same
touched I understand
come here sit sit
this is so much harder than I had
anticipated all right you know what
let's work with this okay this is a
sharpie if you lunge at me it's gonna
get on you crummy so look this is my
outfit okay bitch PG is going to be the
unfortunate position of next to guilty
that's my good girl okay peachy Wow
okay that's fine you can face mom this
isn't gonna be enough yeah like okay
like there ish oh now you're gonna sit
still on here Barry thinks day let me
stay oh sweet oh God
sweaty now we cut ain't the only thing
that really needs to be like a big hole
is their head hole but I'm going to try
wrestle them like slits so then we can
maybe adjust them but we're probably
gonna have to adjust everything this is
a fucking mess fuck show of an idea PT
practicable if I stay any chicken work
fine
hey promise just looking at me like why
all right what are you guys thanks all
their head holes are so big they're like
coming out how's it feel
who's whose arm all as this purpose it's
you forever Bow Wow guys no doing this
back at all
alright what about a triple dog Wow
Jenna
at the risk of their head walls being
too small I made them too large so they
can all just get out of it so what's
next well I mean is there any sense in
trying it in this you know I thought
that maybe this would just be too baggy
and then a stretch fabric will be better
but I don't think just mashing them
closer with a stretchy fabric is even
gonna help which means you can buy this
on sale on my Etsy storage why am I like
this at Etsy calm slash Gmail one
hundred eight seven six five four three
oh five nine that's a different bit
earlier and a song so here's my last
resort I got them all matching
sweatshirts live in a kennel and I'm

so funny
she's so guilties gonna be on the end
because she's unpredictable then peach
because she does like guilty a lot then
permit cuz he like speech and then
marble cos car mats the only one that he
trusts but here's the difficult thing
right so Kermit's arms are like there we
have to glue like the top of marble

complicated
well over there yeah you seen your dog
who's being wild earlier so that looks
about right right should all their
fronts should be lined up yes ooh maybe
