I have a dog suitcase so as many of you
guys know this month is dog birthday
month all of them have a birthday in
June problems was the fifth peachy's
15th Kermit's the 20th and my mom's dog
had her birthday on the 10th which means
every five days is a dog person so I
want to do something nice for them
collectively all together especially
since on occasion we have forgotten
Kermit's birthday because his left and
at that point we're all birthday it out
and he's a middle child so it's all our
fault we just forget about him it's
getting hot out I'm wearing a beanie
because I'm covering up the fact that
I'm not very good at clipping in hair
extension I'm hot but I thought
something nice to do for the dogs for
their birthday is throw them a beautiful
pool party because they love water
it's my lying face they don't like water
at all they don't like baths they don't
like pools they don't want to go in it
but you know what it's birthday month
and it's summertime the weekend so exact
full party game which I don't have a
pool so we got some kiddie pools and
some pool stuff and we're just going to
throw them a little pool party for the
birthday
Jackson's would never throw his dog's a
pool party bobble you ready for a pool
party he's ready you he's ready I got
two different kiddie pools I got this
one for very obvious reasons it's shaped
like a shark and stuff comes out of its
tail consider it sold and this one is
backup pool in case something happens to
the far superior shark pools I'm also
not going to get in the pool because it
who Julian are you going to get in the
pool yeah are you really why not we
didn't think this all the way through
all we have is a bike pump I'm just
trying to pass out set it you know try
to stay conscious to k17 feels like it's
not doing anything so we're just
inflating the tail right now getting a
parent fucking stupid see what mommy's
doing for you guys I don't even care
can you like make this the Alps more no
so make sure there's no way we're in
playing that second pool there's
absolutely no way well I mean it really
took like four hours but pool tour so
here's the shark pool Petey are you
excited I think it's really nice and it
is person-sized so I might leave this up
and then use it at a later date
privately in the cover on my own huh I
felt like the adults that I am we are
going to fill it up with some water like
from the hose but then I'm going to put
some warm water in here also because
they're babies and they don't like cold
water we also have a number of toys we
have some fishing set for Julian a knife
when we get bored and then we got each
of the dogs a little floaties marbles
Kermit and Peach
this was definitely Kermit though guys
it might be nighttime by the time you
get in the pool this is taking so
fucking long cool just of already got
some hot water in here our hose doesn't
have a screw so we can't enjoy the
fountain coming out of the tail but I
think that's ok because they would get
too cold and sure you can google it if
you were looking forward to the sprinkle
coming on hallo I'm sorry to be a
disappointment what do you say we get
somebody in here Kermit you want to be
first time to go swimming at the
birthday when what do you think do you
feel like a human child sit in the pool
