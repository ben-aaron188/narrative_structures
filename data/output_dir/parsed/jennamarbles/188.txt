so I went to college for psychology
which is cool great and awesome but like
what about all the electives that I
didn't get to take I haven't taken part
since like high school and I really just
sometimes wouldn't be good at art and
ain't nobody got time for art school
time-cost boo I want it for free on
YouTube from someone that knows what the
fuck they're doing that's me that's how
I vented Jenna's drunk art school my
opinion the only way to learn is to just
do I'm gonna turn on Jenna's drunk brain
which is always the most creative I have
a bunch of art supplies and I want to be
water coloring gotta be doing something
that you like so I want to paint a
picture of Rihanna so I'm gonna get
drunk and I'm gonna take you to what
fucking art school I'm fucking hammered
so now that I'm like free drunk like I
was sitting outside my hair is like my
hair is not like my hair was yours drunk
first things first
look at my reference picture and draw
like an outline and then after that I'm
gonna watercolor in it that's all though
I don't like to stay within the lines in
life I need some lines to know that I'm
going outside the lines oh my god
fucking philosophical look two legs I
need to see it because I can't see it
just put it on your screen but don't
worry about it look at your business so
we got Rihanna's fucking hair oh it's
looking good all right now we need to
translate the hair into the face Rihanna
is the most important thing in this
picture not Melyssa Ford we're gonna
draw that one off her face oh it doesn't
look it doesn't look right now in my
opinion I don't even know yet I don't
know because I don't know art but what
seems like the most complicated part in
this picture is this ratchet-ass fucking
hand right here not ratchet is
Rihanna's ratchet but saying I don't
know Hydra hands so I'm gonna just
fuckin I'm gonna do my best and there's
one two three four five
oh they're not all index fingers though
general I do this whatever I don't know
I don't know we we should draw Melissa
port open those and she's on her phone
I'm debating because I've never worked
in the medium of art or drawing before
if I should keep trying or if I should
just start painting veteran Leland do we
have Rios very Borden we're drawing a
portrait if someone has a lot of
intricate tattoos on their head
we should probably draw them in with pen
and not paint the sun's coming from in
over here so you're like oh this parts
any green now we need this like tribal
crazy shifts but now in the least racist
way possible we need to make Rihanna
Rihanna color and then give her big hair
you got to put your lightest colors
first oh we have this yellow stuff so
brush technique you want to see what
happens to people like that and then see
what happens to people like that should
so toke more folks aren't told me okay
so something that we've learned just now
pens and watercolor aren't like the best
mix cuz if you didn't go to Janet Strunk
art school for free mind you you
wouldn't have learned that you would
have put them together now by yourself
so let's see what happens if we take our
pen and try and draw with a lot of
colors it looks great I'm really pleased
with that you get any drips or anything
that's cool just like
as quickly as you can blend them into
the painting before they ruin your dip
so in order to draw you shape you just
drop fucking you so part of your paint
probably you guys like an aggressive the
mud black in the white but that's okay
we gotta get around there's white ass
paint job that's not white it's close
enough wide you can get or yellow the
sun's not fucking bramble of support
what are you doing in the least racist
way possible Melyssa Ford is this color
oh we've got a drip she's getting a
witch nose and then we're just gonna
blend this shit is Melissa is now
becoming a faceless piece of work but
that's fine this is not blackface so
stop being so fucking racist all right
no color in all these fucking gasps ice
cream Rihanna's or now wearing a green
tank top
Iger need to paint and Melyssa Ford's
hair that shit is black as fuck and if
you get any drips that's okay looks like
fucking hair get a mouse in there oh
she's smearing she hates her like oh
it's weird and we need a job Oh
general what did you say I didn't say
shit you know let's just get a big-ass
brush because we're not the bigger the
better come on
and then we're gonna use a technique
called I don't give a fuck like here's
something that you can learn in Jenna's
stroke art school you need more white
paint than you think
alright now I'm gonna get oh there's
some green let's get all I went into
your face that's okay oh I don't know
how to fix that though just like just
getting with your hand all right better
and there's why put on your pants oh
it's so magenta don't worry if you're a
painter and you know what you're doing
in the art world
why are you something with this much
white I don't know why I've only been
painting for like half an hour and I
know that it won't wipe them out the
fuck is your problem
Heidi's Jed I'm the master of the color
wheel didn't fuck yourself pink pink
watercolor this is way too dark God need
for the white right sometimes you feel
look like they're bleeding that's okay
because sometimes that that's accurate
and pretend that she wants to go for a
messy ombre and no direction look I'm
just gonna let that bitch dry and see
what it looks like cuz I don't know I
don't know if you peeping starts crying
just like Vic tears away cognize the
point where you help your imaginary
friend Rihanna fix their makeup eyebrows
are like higher ground
so all you gotta do is fucking pick a
brown let's use that same like a little
bit and like make her some contours on
her nose and yes we lost those oh my god
she's dying oh my god what should we do
the paint finish Melyssa Ford you're
looking a little sad what can we do for
you
oh that oh nothing we can't do anything
I'm gonna take my pen and Rihanna's cam
looks like shit alright let's be honest
with ourselves it's sort of works it
also looks like shit so that's the
downside oh it's so decorative
alright so things that we fucking learn
today you should draw with your marker
after you watercolor right this is a
free education service for you
I did all the guesswork and like yeah
you could have read it in a book but
like why the fuck would you want to do
that this is my watercolor and marker
painting of Rihanna but I am going to
stop there why not put some stickers on
there you do need to go to art school go
to Jenna's drum art school the tuition
is $0 you're automatically accepted you
don't even have to fucking apply I don't
care about your criminal record or your
fucking deal will support deserves
flower too let's draw their jewelry it
is we don't give shit okay there's some
fucking rules I'm gonna waste my time
going to art school I didn't pay you
look so fucking hot I didn't mean injury
I'm sorry is this better work art school
