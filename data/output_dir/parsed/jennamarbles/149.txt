peachie queen slickly hi friends and
welcome to my bed this week I wanted to
do something a little bit different that
I usually do or have ever done this is
not going to be a funny video at all
this week just you've been warned
I just got back from Gatlinburg in
Pigeon Forge Tennessee with mamrie we're
shooting hey USA this month is really
busy for me usually the spring is the
busiest time in terms of travel for me
and this might be a video that I would
upload to my blog channel instead of my
main channel but just for purposes of my
sanity and things like that I'm not
quite like exhausted yet but I know over
the course of the next month or two I
will get very tired so I think it's
important every once in a while to give
yourself like a little bit of a mental
break so I really just wanted to like
have a more relaxed video this week
that's all right with you friends so
this video might be a little bit longer
than usually is I mentioned I think it
was in my draw my life videos when I
first mentioned it I'm like kind of a
secretly sentimental person and I like
to keep like anything that means stuff
to me in shoeboxes a suggestion on my
Facebook about a week or two ago and for
me to bust out my diary from when I was
a young girl like Guardian or whatever
and read some of it and I was like why
stop there when we could just go through
all of this really exciting wonderful
things that I keep for myself and mind
you I'm not going to show you everything
that's in there there's plenty of things
that I would never show anyone plus it's
also really important I think to keep
things to yourself like some things you
should just have for you that the world
doesn't need to know about but for the
most part these boxes are filled with
things for boys and like notes and cute
little things and I'll also show you
some stuff close up if if it calls for
it and there's no reason why you would
ever maybe watch this video unless you
liked me as a person which I know a lot
of you are like look you Jenna I came in
for the jokes bitch make some jokes
bitch maybe it's stupid maybe you don't
do this but I really like to keep things
I'd say every couple of years I go
through these boxes and like look at
stuff and like laugh and reminisce
and I think it's a nice thing to do to
remember like different parts of your
life and where you've come from and how
far you've gone and to also remember
that you're only an adolescent one time
and then it doesn't happen again it's
only like really really really awful and
weird for like a little bit and then it
gets better then you're more equipped
with like better tools to deal with life
but like some of the stuff in here man
I'm like oh I do not want to relive that
I want to show you some cool things that
I keep in my boxes in my box in my box I
think this one I keep some of the like
older older stuff in so let's go into
this one first right off the top I see
three notebooks full of things I've
written in one I think is just actually
my notes
let's read October 16th 1998 capitalized
and put quotation marks around poem
titles I loved the poem my beard is
literally what I wrote
apparently I really like these things
that's how I separated things my beard
that's all
ah here we go I found the good stuff in
the back of my notes are all my games of
mash she literally just like spell the
word and then fucking write out all this
different shit and then it will for tell
your future where would I live Oakland
Australia Florida Rochester I got
Oakland we live in a greenhouse a green
mansion I've got a honeymoon to Toronto
ha we I am a I don't even know what that
word is faster babysitter I don't know
what Judas what's a job that's Jude I'm
gonna drive a Corvette oh but I could
have drove a Lamborghini or a Sun Frey
clearly I know my cars I'm gonna have a
rat as a pet I'm going to make a dollar
for my salary the cars red and I have a
hundred thousand kids oh good stuff
clearly taking a lot of notes in English
this is my old glasses case which I was
obsessed with spelling with all the
movie tickets that I got to go to a
riveting play that I saw at my high
school
riveting you saw Austin Powers $4 we had
some JCC Maccabi madness $8 for that
jeez I saw swimfan
Blue Crush the first harry potter $4.50
the rochester Nighthawks 90-80 ex-wife

black Mandy Moore Eiffel 65 so this is a
perfect example of things that I like to
keep in this box a reading from one of
my first boyfriends in middle school
Jeff hey how are you I'm fine I'm in
study hall right now it's really boring
because mr. Schwartz won't let us do
anything I decided to write to you
because I was so bored I usually don't
write unless I'm written to but I made
an exception I'm really glad we're going
out is your phone number blank if it
isn't tell it to me I tried to call you
over the weekend but I found out you
were at a bar mitzvah or something you
want to do something next weekend about
every other weekend I have a soccer game
I have to go the bells about to ring ly
L love you lots
boyfriend WBS right back soon I think
that's for like six or seven beautiful
this was one of my favorite things to
doodle I like doing that I was
apparently doing math on construction
paper I'm in the red tank top being real
pale and awkward
hey girl and this is also me full braces
trying not to laugh because I hated my
braces playing a conga that's living so
I was on a school field trip to
Washington DC in seventh grade when I
had my first boyfriend ever his name was
Spencer gave me this card with little
bracelet as a bear on the front catching
some butterflies and then on the inside
it says lots of love love Spencer of
course and I was like wah wah and then
like a week later I gave a note to his
friend to give to him to break up with
him so this is a birthday party and we
got to like dress up and have someone
put colored hair spray in her hair and
makeup on her face it always were Sox
that didn't match I was a real rebel
hero fuck the man I went to London one
time when I was in like seventh grade
and used to get these little things just
you know get sullen teenager that's me
the giant sliding scrape on my leg
playing a lot of softball that's me and
my prom dress because if you're going to
prom why wouldn't you wear sequins all
over the place it does this is seriously
so embarrassing right now but when I was
in middle school I absolutely loved
Angelina Jolie and that is a picture of
me sitting in front of my wall covered
in pictures of Angela Jolie but back
when she was like weird and crazy I
looked up to her because I thought she
was cool for having tattoos and not
giving a fuck this is actually really
cool that I still have that I was a
juror on a murder trial for two weeks
like one of the craziest experiences
I've ever had I was like 19 years old
whenever you get called for jury duty
don't just try and skip out on it try
and get picked that's what I did I tried
to get picked I was like yes I wore my
glasses I wore like a jacket it was like
I can be fair and impartial in this
trial and it was and I was actually an
alternate juror so when we deliberated
in stuff I didn't actually make a
decision it's something that everyone
should do you need to be a juror on some
sort of trial in your life because it's
a very important experience to have so
I'm very thankful I had that and fucking
life trip he has a brain trip this is
the program from the one and only play
that I was in in sixth grade I'd be able
to go and I had one line and it was ooh
what happened to your finger and you
know when I get out there's just like
ooh what happening her finger well Jenna
this is why you should go to sit down
and not do this anymore this is a little
journal that I kept olives at Camp like
an all-girls camp was like a leadership
camp we would go through these like
exercises so I'll give you an example if
you had to choose the color to best
describe you what would it be and why
and I remember I would choose gray
because it's blond everyone hates it but
it can be elegant and pretty at times
and it surprises people it also has a
dark side that is depressive and dark
but it has a light side that can be
bright and amazed
Wow well Jenna that's deep shit in this
diary there's not I can't really say too
much that's in here because people's
names that I can change some of its just
like it doesn't need to be shared I'll
do the best that I can
I had study hall with boys today he's so
hot he kept laying on his back three
jacks skinned a row and hanging his head
upside down and talking to me I loved
him the fetch big boy crazy like ow you
ever gone back and like read some of the
subs really sad he said he wanted to
talk to me and I said I did too we plan
to get online at 8:30 in talk that's
when it all happened he told me that
before it all got started he really did
like me I was shivering because he told
me how much he had liked me but then he
said he realized he didn't want to be
any more than just friends and obviously
heart completely sink was ripped out and
stomped on I told him how I liked him
then too but somehow I couldn't gather
the courage to tell him how I felt now
it really brought me back to my senses I
thought for like a month that I didn't
need a notebook to feel good I didn't
need anyone except myself I was so wrong
what I didn't see was that when I wrote
everything down had more confidence and
courage I was happy and was the person I
wanted to be when I stopped I saw that I
was just slipping back into the hole
that I had gotten out of oh well now
that I am loveless and heartless start
that many options left I can't like
so-and-so anymore because my good friend
so-and-so likes him too I would feel so
bad liking him to know I'll find someone
who loves me one day it all love him too
won't that be the day Oh
BRR now that's enough you've made me
feel so much better and I'm so glad
you're such a good listener Thanks love
always Jenna
but I won't look cute no laughter you
brainless is a sad F Jenna why did you
think this was a good idea I don't know
like teenage girl diaries are kind of
fucking like sad and melodramatic yes
baby Jenna no calm down on a spaceship
right now and tell you that everything's
gonna be fine this is just full of life
boys and me liking boys and deciding to
like different boys and then not liking
boys and liking boys and then fighting
with my friends shit show like some of
it's funny some of it's like Co raisi
and then like after all that sad stuff
like then are like a boy and the boy
likes me back and the note is that all
the entries are like and then that was
the last time I saw him and he stayed up
past his bedtime at 9:00 isn't that cute
until 11:00 to talk to me I was so
excited
it's like a fucking roller coaster
reading like I was roller coaster and
this was me
hell I really read all of this because
it's just name after name after name of
like boys I can show you some dresses I
drew I can't wait to get my braces off
it won't be for a few years but still I
hate them to make me look like such a
expletive maybe I'll look a little
better when I get them off and my boobs
grow then I get contacts no more diary
nothing is sad everybody look at this
picture duck-tor looking like a couple
of real a-holes this is a drawing from
first grade I think that's old I would
get the boy that I liked I would get his
French homework and then keep it because
