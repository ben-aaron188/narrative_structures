this hairstyle is called I'm hiding my
roots I posted a picture on Instagram
was like should I keep this and it got
very mixed reviews
so I'm too lazy to take it out so I made
one of these videos in the past you guys
seemed to really like it the comments in
that video are pop in the things I
thought as a kid I've talked about some
of these things in embarrassing stories
one and two as well just you know dumb
shit that I thought as a kid that just
turned out to be the opposite of true so
ever since that last one I have been
gathering the ideas as I remember them
of other dumb things that I thought so I
just wanted to make a part 2 with my
experimental hair because in that video
I had very experimental hair so why not
you know keep keep the theme going tell
something just thought as a kid have
experimental hair the first thing that I
thought as a kid which I never
explicitly asked anyone to explain to me
I think I just grew up and realized it
wasn't true whenever I hear that like
loud rumbling of like a plane taking off
somewhere in the distance not like the
airplane noise but it sounds like a low
Rumble I used to think that that was the
sound of the world tourney I really
thought you know I mean the world's
turning so fast like it's got to make
some noise at some point you know just
the world turning gray pretty stupid
that's not true at all my brother who is
a motherfucker of tricking me like
wearing deodorant on my knee pits one
time he convinced me that all the
animals at the zoo were not real animals
that they were actually robotic
recreations of the animals really took
all of the fun out of going to the zoo
he also liked to convince me that I was
adopted which I believed even though my
mom would show me pictures of her like
in the hospital and then my brother
would be like she just like that's Ivan
you that's a different baby I didn't
really upset me I just was convinced
that I was adopted and that my parents
were gonna tell me someday so I mean
I've been prepared I've been waiting
guys it's okay if you want to tell me I
was adopted so I'm gonna hurt my
feelings cuz I completely grew up
believing my brother I think it was a
Cabbage Patch is what he says where they
found me a Cabbage Patch was a gullible
child
these next two are about sex I'm sorry
it's little inappropriate but I wanted
to tell you what I thought one I thought
that blowjobs meant that you blow on
someone's wee-wee I was very confused
and I don't know why anyone would ever
want
taken that seemed kind of like gross and
invasive I just take things literally I
guess secondly I was not too familiar
with my own anatomy so I know that girls
had vaginas and boys had penises I knew
what sex was but I wasn't a hundred
percent sure how those two things like
got together so in my mind the only way
that I logically could think of that a
boy and a girl like penis and vagina
would have sex is that it would just go
in there like a hot dog it's like a taco
with with a wiener in it so we know taco
I mean it made sense to me okay know
that there was like I don't know man I
thought that steak was actually snake
meat because when we would eat steak I
thought we were saying snake and I would
say snake just thought we were eating
big pieces of snake I don't know what we
did with all of the snake's skin though
I didn't think about that
so you'd ask your friend like hey do you
like snake no man I don't eat snake I
did last night
Wow yeah let's get away from her this
one's a little bit complicated because
it has to do with a cartoon that I'm
sure no one remembers except for me it
was called Popples and they were like
these little animals that like came out
of their little pouches they were like
their own marsupial so the television
show was just them going on adventures
like popping out and being Popples
I had the stuffed orange poeple and I
for some reason got it in my mind that
if you put him in the washing machine it
would turn into a basketball I don't
know where I got that from I don't know
why I thought that I had had this
stuffed poeple for like three years
I was ready like I was so ready I was
like you know what I've enjoyed my
Popple as a stuffed animal but I'm ready
for him to be a basketball now and I
very like unceremoniously walked up to
my mom and was like mom I think it's
time I'd like to wash my Popple in the
washing machine my mom was like uh okay
so she put him in the washing machine I
was like waiting it was like the longest
like 45 minutes ever the poeple comes
out and he's still a stuffed animal and
I was so confused and I was like mom I
think you washed him wrong so I made her
wash him like three more times before I
was like mom I don't understand what's
happening I thought that if I wash the
poeple that it turns into a basketball
and she had to explain to me but that is
the dumbest thing anyone has ever
fucking said when I was a kid I had a
very hard time understanding the word
domesticated you know you learn in
school like what domesticated animals
so I'm like all right I get it animals
that help people and like people have
trained to either be their pet or like
help them I took this in a really weird
direction one time my dad caught a
raccoon in our backyard and he trapped
him and I was like dad I really want to
keep him because that's like my favorite
thing in the world why can't it happen
and he was like he can't keep a raccoon
he's a wild animal
I'm like dad we can domesticate him why
not I would go to someone else's house
and they would have a dog and I'd be
like yeah Zia as he domesticated
thinking that that meant like friendly
to people but then it only got worse
when you know you'd be in an area with
adults drinking beer and they'd be
drinking domestic beer and I'm like does
that mean it's your your pet is the beer
your pet and the first time I heard
domestic partner I was like okay and now
this I don't know what to think is is
that your pet is like if one of you owns
the other one I just remember asking
people if their dog or cat was
domesticated or why we can't domesticate
a tiger because I would like to have one
I don't understand the problem the next
thing I thought as a kid was told to me
by let's say Jessica Mexica one day in
school
Jessica convinced me that if you chug
milk you can actually look at your
fingernails and watch them grow so I
really believed this and I also really
wanted longer nails so I just remember
one time chugging way too much milk for
a child I'm gonna need another milk this
isn't working Jessica I honestly thought
I was just that they're in chug milk and
just watch my nails grow into some fleek
lady gaga shit I was just left with a
stomach full of too much milk and I had
to go to class and it didn't feel good
another thing I thought when I was a kid
was I heard the expression I'm so fall I
could explode like oh I feel like I'm
gonna explode I'm so full I thought that
that was a real thing my Python meaning
of life only reaffirmed my fears that
you could actually explode from eating
so I did my best as a child to cut off
how many chicken nuggets I was eating in
one sitting because I did not want to
physically explode because I thought
that that would be so embarrassing I
didn't even think he would die it just
thought he would explode oh no oh he's
exploding I shouldn't have eaten that
second round of dessert in church when I
was a kid I thought that when they give
you the
in the you know whatever the body and
blood of Christ I thought that was
literal I thought we were literally
going to eat someone's flesh and drink
blood and I was like the seems very
savage I'm not sure I want to do it
after I figured out that that wasn't
true at all I'm gonna taste delicious
the next thing that confused the hell
out of me though was that I was an altar
server and part of your duty is to go in
the back and fill up the big chalice
with communion and I realized that they
come in a box like rich crackers like
their except they're Jesus crackers and
I just had all sorts of like mind crises
I feel like I'm being lied to you
telling me you guys bought these at the
store you can buy Jesus at the store I
guess I never thought about where
Jesus's cracker body came from but it
was a rude awakening when I realized
that it was not heaven it was the Jesus
store when I was pretty little I went to
school with a kid that thought putting
your finger in someone else's
bellybutton was having sex with them so
one day he was like hey ah can I put my
finger in your bellybutton uh sure why
not sure you want to do this yeah I mean
it's just my bellybutton but I mean you
make me feel weird about it now but yeah
I'm still down he put his finger in my
belly button and like got really excited
about it and then informed me that we
had just had sex and I was like I
respectfully disagree at least I knew
that sex happened with your genitals I
thought it worked like a hot dog but I
mean that's just a stupid man when I was
very little I thought that as soon as
you had a bathing suit on the rules of
peeing no longer applied we only had
like sprinklers or like a lake it was
never in a pool so just be like running
around the backyard it's time to pee
like standing up like whatever man ma'am
I bet ensues no rules right now figured
out that that is not a rule it's wildly
inappropriate just because you have a
bathing suit on doesn't mean you can
just urinate all over yourself you
filthy fuck when I was very little I
thought that all aunts were one aunt
named Anita I did not understand the
concept of multiple aunts even if I
would see multiple aunts they were one
aunt and they were all named Anita for
example I would take Anita but I need it
in my pocket
my mom would wash my pants or be ants
all over them and then I would ask my
mom wearing it is and she go well why
don't you go outside and find a new
Anita Jenna and I'm like that's not how
this works at all you washed my fucking
friend now he's dead I'd say about 2nd
grader so we learned that if you
a worm in half that'll become two worms
or like the lizard gets panicky he'll
lose his tail and grow a new tail so I
figured that anyone that didn't have an
arm or a leg was just in the process of
growing a new armored leg not only that
but the arm or leg in the other place
was growing a new person on it if only
the world worked that way but you have
to admit that that is quite an
optimistic opinion to have as a child
and lastly although this was not me I
was babysitting a girl one time that
really did not understand how money
worked we were hanging out we hear an
ice-cream truck pass by and she goes
Janet come on I want some ice cream
let's go I was like uh I mean I would
but I don't have any money and she just
looked at me very matter-of-factly and
what we'll go get some bitch what the
fuck do you think I'm doing here
babysitting you for I'm like 14 I have
no money I get paid in silver dollars to
rake leaves just like all right well you
make me a hot dog then all right fuck
fine those were some more things that I
thought as a kid I thoroughly enjoyed
