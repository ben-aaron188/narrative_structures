all right so here's my video I'm not
crazy crazy crazy we make things John
cotton as I beware
like he's crazy I want your have until
angry and frustrated that all you want
to do is just tell everyone that you
know how angry you are that's what I
feel like right now so let me give you
over the background ah me and max moved
out of our old apartment and we fell in
this place we needed a third roommate I
posted many times on Facebook like
Craigslist whatever I was trying to find
somebody live with us we couldn't I met
this kid randomly on the street he hit
on me as you put my phone number I was
like nodded and all set and I was like
you can with paper on Facebook so we
were friends on Facebook every time I
posted something this can respond like
I'm great roommate only to move so our
last resort I was like I'll just contact
us kid or whatever he came at all places
like it was really cool I'd like to live
here totally right fine you know I will
go awesome weird I was before nothing is
you know not doable to me I can get
along pretty much anybody um so you know
then immediately starts being crazy like
he moves and all this crazy ass shit
like he has so much shit ah it's crazy
so things started to get a little bit
weird when he wanted to switch our cable
service and instead of you know being a
grown up and being like hey I want to
switch our cable service he sent himself
a fake Comcast letter saying that our
services are gonna be terminated because
someone downloaded the song beep by the
Pussycat Dolls um so he's like you know
Kansas oh sorry guys our cable got shut
up because someone illegally download
their song it was like
erroneous that's not possible sorry nice
try you're fuckin idiot oh so of course
the cable stayed on it same day he went
out bought another TV so that we could
have a second room to like chillin which
is the study I'll show you in a little
bit um so me and Max haven't been in a
living room since like September it's
like this big-ass room he's like claimed
for himself
pull his shit he told me not to bring
any of my furniture here because he's
got plenty of stuff everything's gonna
be all set so we like me messing on the
saw study in watch TV and hang out and
he's like constantly going in there like
this little last room why would you go
in there and give this giant living room
all to yourself connected to room we
don't go in there you're like oh he's
crazy he comes in there like he's got
like his like headset to his phones and
I'm fucking gay hate my life but like in
front of us like just for attention he's
like constantly taking the garbage out
and like do dishes right in front of us
so you see him like he's narcissist he
loves having everyone pay attention to
him it's crazy so last night we were me
max are in the study me and Max are in
the study and like I've gotten in a
couple like brawls this kid like verbal
just like fuck you like what is your
problem you're crazy
and so he keeps coming into the study
and like just bothering us like what is
your problem
just go away
and so he tells us that we need to get
up because he means to get into the
closet behind us and even they're like
digging like you're digging in your
attic like for nothing he's just like
looking at shit and still after like
seven minutes of him looking through
this you know I was like you know what
what is your fucking problem like what
are you doing and he's a good just once
on my stuff he whips out like an old-ass
mp3 player some headphones like some
cable Jack's I don't even know like
nothing that you really need and I'm
like you know what fuck that he goes oh
sorry princess am i bothering you like
that's his go-to is that he loves to
make fun of me because he thinks I'm a
princess which is false

like oh sorry princes my father am like
yeah you know what you fucking are like
I fucking heat you know then you die go
kill yourself kill your mother like I
don't care and you just like lost my
shit I was like you know what I fucking
had it
I take all his dumbass furniture all
this little room which I'll show you so
you can see who dumb it is and I start
throwing it and his wrong and throwing
it in the basement and moving everything
like stuff that doesn't need to be here
and he calls the cops and the cops come
in and they're like what's the problem
and I was like you know what his stuff
is been in the house for so long it
doesn't need to be here it's just crazy
actually hairdresser like in the kitchen
in this room like all these boxes a
giant table that's you know huge that
all you can do is play chess on or it
can be used as a table but it's still
got chess all over it um and I was like
you know what to be honest there's what
this one space like the two of us just
want this one a little last face and
that's it and the cop was just like dude
why don't you just give them their space
like this is a bad apartment
why can't you just you know move your
stuff out of there and John's like going
up a little but he's drunk the cops are
like yeah that dudes drunk isn't he hit
like he's always drunk
he's always drunk he crashed his
Mercedes convertible because he's drunk
and what was I wrong
well that is any crashed into a Comcast
car huh talk about Karma for sending
fake Comcast letter to yourself idiot um
so the cops came and they basically he
called the cops on me and they were
basically you know what you need to grow
up like give them their space what is
wrong with you this is not a reason to
call the cops and they left they took
his name
they're like while he's drunk and it was
hilarious and aggravating so I'm gonna
take you guys to show you the rooms why
this is so fucking ridiculous
okay so John locked the living room door
in there he didn't lock his bedroom door
I did so this is John's room um whatever
the point I'm trying to make is that
it's connected to the living room so
this is the lovely living room where
John gets to live this was the circle
chair that was in study this is you know
all his furniture his piano you know his
lovely artwork whatever he also has a
fireplace a TV like this is where John
gets to hang out it is connected to his
bedroom by door so that we can't get in
there this is John from you know nice
room whatever that's where John cocina
that's John's fucking world
so you walk down the hallway here's the
kitchen this is the kitchen this is the
other part of the kitchen which was full
of his fucking shit it was like a
dresser here like a bunch of speaker
amps over there with a bunch of boxes
there were the giant TV that you saw in
the living room all of the boxes were
right here like all all of the boxes for
everything we're right there and they
don't need to be there this room was
just full of his shit
so then this is the pantry kitchen
whatever this is the study where me and
max hang out so the circle chair used to
be right there and there's a computer
chair right there there's a chess table
right in the middle this is the one
little room like two feet away from the
TV or me and max hang out and it what it
had his furniture in here
this was the closet that he apparently
needed to get into I'll show you
it's full of coats and like random shit
that's what he needed to get out of this
room random ass shit we're gonna book it
for animation fucking crazy-ass psycho
so now we're in the basement
but I took all this shit down here and I
know you can't really see it but there's
like giant boxes like all this shit you
can't see any of that but it's like it's
basically I moved so much stuff down
here and the cops came looked at it and
they were just like well this long stuff
like why does it need to be up there
wheels huge' pieces crazy so as you can
see I'm fucking pissed off today um he
was here all day because he took the day
off work like he does every day because
he's trying to get fired to collect
unemployment and go back to school
instead of taking out loans like the
rest of us um he's trying to collect
unemployment and so he was here til one
I was bobbing my fucking southern rap
whatever I don't care all hair don't
care and because he's the 30 year old
hippie and only does it was such a
sublime like some weed and never grew up
and he wants to go back to school and
finish his bachelor's degree he claims
to be an engineer and then he makes
$100,000 a year and yet he lives in an
apartment here in a room an apartment
well the 23 to 25 year old and has no
car anymore he crash it and he's just
like a waste of life like I hate him I
hate him I hate him I hate him and I'm
so angry and thank you for listening to
me I feel sorry and that's what you get
poem cops on me so go fuck yourself
you
