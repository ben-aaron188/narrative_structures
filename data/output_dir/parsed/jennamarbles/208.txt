cheeri everybody shut up
let's you ever have one side of your
hair that doesn't like the curl and then
the other side it's okay it's real life
you just go like this and then you
problem solved I make two of these
videos in the past and that is things
that boys don't understand or guys don't
understand but this is like one of the
most requested videos that I keep
fucking making these because I don't
know there's a lot of fucking things the
guys won't understand and it's really
hard to get all of them in into one
video so sorry I'm just writing a
fucking video novel over here I'll buy
myself don't mind me this is gonna be
part fucking three of things that guys
won't understand and I'm sure it won't
be the last because there's just so much
stuff here I'm just trying to like maybe
debunk some things for guys that you can
be less confused some more you know
rainbow and if you're a girl hopefully
you can relate to some of these things
if not all of these things so yeah
here's the trifecta of the things that
guys would understand here comes the
hat-trick video it's a tip with the
trick in it is hetrick first thing guys
don't understand that breaking a nail is
not something that we should be made fun
of for first of all breaking your nails
it's pretty painful it kind of hurts
like a lot dear men if you've ever
broken a toenail I don't sit there and
make fun of you and call you a sissy and
a wuss
shit hurts it's connected to an
extremity with lots of nerves in it and
it fucking sucks just put that in the
basket and we'll leave that there and
then I'm gonna put more in the basket
part two in the basket for me personally
I was an athlete my entire life so I
never had the luxury of having really
fun exciting feminine looking nails I
had to have you know really short nails
by choice or not they were just fucking
break no matter what so might as well
just keep them short but now as an adult
I really enjoy having the long nails and
these motherfuckers take a long-ass time
to grow out so when you break one off
and your adventure they get some fake
shit on there or cut them all and
fucking start all over again
like I guess the only analogy I could
come up with for a guy if you spent like
six months growing out like your faux
hawk or some hairdo that you like and
then all of a sudden you were just
hanging out casually and the top of it
snapped off I mean how would you feel it
sucks
or like if I just came into your room at
night and cut all your hair off it's not
fun but there's no pain involved in that
so again factoring the pain factor fuck
you I don't want to hear about it when
you make fun of me for breaking my nails
because it hurts I put time and money in
it and invested in them for them to look
cute and is gonna suck to fix it okay it
doesn't make me a fucking pussy it just
means it's something that I care about
it's not broken
and if you would like to feel that way
and call me names I'll make sure that I
will get your PlayStation controller
throw it in toilet see how you feel what
something that you like gets broken
another thing guys don't understand is
they'll tell us that we're really
confusing and they can't understand like
if we like them or not or like playing
mind games or what we're doing well the
reason for that is because probably we
also don't know how we feel about you
we're just texting you back like joining
awesome time ahaha I don't know maybe
like Tuesday so I'm kind of busy I don't
know it's cuz I'm fucking know how I
feel about you either
okay like you think that I'm not telling
you how I feel but I'm just trying to
feel you out just like you we're in the
same boat called sexual confusion
another thing guys don't understand is
how we want to be loved many guys like
to chalk us up to material belongings
flowers spontaneous acts of romance
dinners when really when we say little
things we literally mean little fucking
things let me tell you what will go a
mile have you ever gone over to a girl's
house and like taking out her garbage or
like done some dishes fucking hello
thing is like chivalry let you have
swept me off my feet a guy comes over my
house and takes off the garbage for me
I'm sorry but I'm pretty sure that's
grounds for each state love love you
want to move in please be my roommate
can I marry you for the most part
flowers and things like that dinners
that's all really nice but all we want
to do is
feel like you care and if you're not a
very vocal person and you can't express
your emotions verbal you just show me
some other way
well not complicate it we just want to
feel the love bro I want to feel it in
my heart and in my garbage also I'll not
say no guys don't understand how far a
handwritten note will go you'll hand
write me a note you get a week-long pass
on this rollercoaster if you write me a
handwritten note guys don't understand
why we take so many selfies I've been
made fun of for taking selfies many many
many at once because let me tell you
something girls as a species we are
detail-oriented does it look like I have
a lazy eye or crossed I like can you see
my cool hair just fucking half an hour
doing my hair want my hair to be in the
picture about mine can't reach so you
take all these pictures so that you can
get an attractive one and then post it
on the internet so people think that you
just took it haphazardly what you didn't
I don't know any girl that can just take
a picture by themselves and then just
have that look right if a guy really
wants to make fun of a girl for taking a
lot of selfies before she gets the right
one I would like to see you take a
picture of yourself one time look at it
tell me that you're not like look like
sometimes you can just fucking see if
your nose and into things that you don't
want to see and then nobody wants to see
you you know that because the girl that
takes one selfie and then posts it
that's how you end up having your like
really weird shit in the background of
your pictures and then you become an
internet meme it's like proofreading
your pictures nobody just writes a paper
and fucking gives it to their teacher
know you feel like editing a little bit
like what if you fucking broke penis in
there by accident or on purpose
you have to proofread your own work
that's what you're doing editing guys
don't understand that I don't want a
picture of your dick period just doesn't
doesn't do much for me guys don't
understand when we're doing our makeup
particularly our eyes why we make so
many funny faces when you open your
mouth it keeps your eyes from blinking I
just sat there and inside my mouth
closed would be fucking blinking mad
makeup into my eyes that's just a
fucking one-way ticket to our town
population me I don't want to get that
shit my eyes like black and gooey
gup-e some of its glue keep your mouth
open it keeps you from blinking it's
fucking science google it another thing
guys that i understand and that we get a
lot of shit for when a guy asks you
there's something wrong or are you okay
you're like I'm fine and you don't give
a real answer that's just because we're
letting something brew okay
we're not quite ready to talk to you
about something whatever it is most
likely bad and you can tell that it's
bad but it's because we're letting it
like stew and thinking about how we want
to fucking attack you with it if you ask
the girl what's wrong she says nothing
I'm fine just think of that as like the
warning wave before fucking tsunami cuz
it's about to go down another thing guys
don't understand is how we always have a
closet full of clothes and nothing to
wear let me just fucking explain
something to you about economics and
utility a lot of us buy you know tank
tops and shirts that are really cute but
sort of disposable like forever 21 H&M
that's our thing like you paid $5 $10
for a shirt or a tank top you wear it
five or six times there's like pictures
of you in it you can't just fucking keep
wearing that shit at that point you've
gotten your five or ten dollars worth
out of it cuz that's embarrassing you
can just fucking wearing the same
clothes all the time you're that girl so
when we say we have nothing to wear it's
not that we don't physically have
anything to wear we do we pride
ourselves on being able to mix old
clothes with new clothes we're saying we
don't have any new combinations of
things that would make it seem like I
have clothes to wear it's just gonna
look like I'll have all the same clothes
which sucks nobody likes to feel like
that like brings you back to something
great we're like three days a week I
should just wear the same fucking shirt
and pants because I like them
and then I learned that that was like a
little bit socially weird you know so
we're all just fighting that like inner
somebody's gonna judge me if they see me
in the same outfit we're just forever
you know thirteen-year-old girls that's
also why you can make fun of us all you
want for really like accessories like
shoes and bags or belts or jewelry or
whatever these are things that we're
getting more utility out
said so if you pay a little bit more for
a necklace or some earrings or shoes you
get to wear those relatively more for
your money than you would say a shirt or
a jacket where at some point you got to
stop fucking wearing that thing because
it's starting to get weird and gross on
top of that please don't make fun of us
they're not girl things all right
they're fucking smart investments
especially jewelry gold holds its Valley
fuck you we're smarter than you think
don't jizz in our hair ever especially
if we just wash it and did it shame on
you sir I need a new target not cool
nope guys also don't understand that
sometimes we like to be a little bit
artsy in terms of our hair or makeup I
don't try actively to always make myself
look like fucking I'm gonna give you a
boner sometimes I wanna fucking wear
black lipstick and do it every fucking
walk why I don't know because I watch 10
fucking YouTube tutorials about it and I
feel like I've mastered the technique
and I'm really excited about it and I
just want to fucking do it okay I'm
really excited that's it I don't care
you don't like it and that you think
that I look fucking insane the last time
I checked my face was my face not your
face if at any point you back handedly
apps me is that that time of the month
or anything along those lines consider
yourself dead for the foreseeable future
and the last thing that guys don't
understand this is completely gross and
inappropriate and too much information
altogether and does not need to be sure
but it's true we're phantom poopers and
let me tell you why there's so much
shame built around girls pooping most of
us out of survival have just become
really really really fucking good at it
look we can go in the bathroom goat
doodoo in the same amount of time that
it would take someone to go peepee and
you would never even know fantastic at
pooping so yeah this has been part 3 of
things that guys do not understand and
there's many many many more but let me
know if there's any that you guys can't
they go because I can think of so many
but at this point it's kind of that make
sure you subscribe to my channel so
