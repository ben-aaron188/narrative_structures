I know what you're thinking you're
saying Jenna your hair looks like
passable as a hairdo why are you
touching it again well you see I was
perusing the beautiful people community
as I usually do I found something that
piqued my interest I did this myself
and I'm still very pleased with it and
you know what I said to myself I could
use like 10 times more of it my
experience with extensions is I have a
set of clippings upstairs that are very
long they're red and I've used them like
five times tops my only other experience
with hair extensions is a long time ago
like maybe seven years ago my friend was
like girl I'll give you hair extensions
I'm gonna glue them into your head I was
like so good she glued a bunch of pieces
of hair into my head it felt wrong it
looked wrong and I was like you know can
I swim and stuff in them and like shower
and she's like yeah you do whatever you
want they last like six to eight weeks
I'm like say so later like that weekend
I went to the beach and I went swimming
in the ocean and then all of a sudden I
was surrounded by my hair extensions so
that's my only other experience with any
kind of hair extensions I know I'm like
super far behind because hair extensions
are like a huge thing a lot of people
wear them a lot of people love them and
I feel like I'm missing out on the fun
so I looked up like glue and hair
extensions but there's something I
didn't even know about which is taping
extensions so you don't clip them you
don't glue them you don't show them you
don't bond them you just tape them which
sounds like the level of commitment I
would like to make it's almost 20 18 I
want to ring in the New Year looking
like a snack I want to join the Tana
mojo elite hair extension Club where you
can just see shit all over your head I
want to be part of the fun okay I
watched one tutorial on how to do it per
usual this is probably the most effort
I've ever put into my own hair aside
from clipping in hair extensions a
couple of times like spending two hours
doing it obviously they don't sell hair
extensions in this color so what I did
was that bar a bunch of beautiful blonde
hair extensions and
we gon die Oh unless you think I should
just take them in blonde should I really
just go full-blown I'm lost at the
supermarket these were not cheap so I
really want to like totally fucked up
also I could not find the color I
actually dyed my heroin they didn't have
it so we're already off to a really
mediocre start so I got the closest one
that I could find it's like a navy blue
and you know what if it like if it
doesn't really match the rest of my hair
fine look at my roots it doesn't matter
hey duh you sort of like sandwich them
in your hair is what someone said in a
YouTube video so this is probably gonna
be quite the process so I hope that you
brought a snack and have nothing to do
today because I also watched one YouTube
video about how to dye these and it was
called like how to dye your hair the
lazy way so just know that's where do
you think I instructed I didn't even
watch it I just must get forward to the
part about eight bundles of hair dawg
wait so you're doing 64 strips I don't
know stop embarrassing me in front of
the beautiful people community
stop it I'm gonna get my hair out of the
way so I don't dye it with this
exquisite grungy bitch there's no rules
I'll just use my tried-and-true method
which is this oh it's coming out
beautiful all fucking ready look at that
even beautiful color deposit I wonder
whose hair this was is it is it person
hair alright so I'm just gonna be doing
this for like ten hours and it's so much
easier to dye hair that's not on your
head it's gonna be worth it I'm gonna be
a Christmas snack and you're gonna be
jealous as hell do you think I showed it
on the beauty school no Beauty school
beauty school would have stifled my
spirit they kick you out
thank you hairdresser resistant
what's what do you want your title to be
paired or there's probably a barber
somewhere that has that name there needs
to be what's gonna be funny is when
we're just hanging out and a chunk of my
hair just go finally someone can like
pull up track of my hair that's falling
out and be like whose is this and I can
sit there and act like it's not mine
probably like a little more than halfway
done I got a lot of hair because I
figured like if I get to a point where I
don't want to put any more in I'd rather
have too many then have just like six
long-ass pieces of hair oh no I don't
think you want to come up here Pichu
peach peas carefully your nose is gonna
be blue not for you okay you got a city
block here's the last one is kind of
relaxing like maybe I'll just die hair
extensions and then give them to people
like Merry Christmas I got you some hair
I say we let these sit for a little
while I just made that so much worse and
then we're gonna rinse them out and then
I'm gonna stick them in my head okay
let's do it so Julie set me up with some
nice bowls simple and conditioner smelly
leave it on forever
air-sea when I'm done rinsing them and
shampooing them all like they're little
people I'm gonna put them where they
belong which is on this dirty towel on
I know you just can't wait to run your
fingers through my hair and just feel it
what's it take there's some splotchiness
in here but it's consistent with the
work that's on my head
we finished washing and conditioning all
of the hair extensions so we're gonna
let them dry for a little bit I'm gonna
Google whether or not I'm supposed to
blow dry them or not and then when
they're dry let's think it's time the
hair is dry I did lightly blow-dry it
and I'm kind of an idiot because I did
look up on YouTube that you can actually
die like to the tape but this was gonna
come out but in one way or another
at some point so mine's like an inch of
but let's hope it works anyway for not
having the same hair dye the color came
out like fucking amazing I'm gonna be
using this highly scientific picture of
where to put my hair extensions
legitimately don't know how to part my
hair down here Mari struggling that's
not a good part it's me Jenna please
send your help me party my hair kid and
my babysitter used to be like do you
want some volume in your hair and I go
yeah and she'd maybe flip my head upside
down she brush it and it would hurt so
bad why are you laughing is it my
scrunchie take off the tape you pick up
a little piece put it under first and
then you put it over are you kidding me
yo this is quite possibly the hardest
thing I've ever done
why do I have so much hair I have to do
this a million times
don't judge me it needs to be lined up
or else I'll have sticky glue sticking
all over can't see shit alright then I
press it together Oh
okay the blonde root is like an absolute
disaster but look at this okay I'm done
I just made a rat tail if I was an alien
and I came to this planet I feel like
one of the things I would find
absolutely hysterical is that we like to
wear each other's hair they definitely
look like I did them myself in videos
they're like glaze over this party like
ok just part your hair bitch this is the
hardest show I've ever done we could
just color the blond parts of the
extensions with a blue marker okay like
I know that I'm not particularly gifted
and like a little half a see but like
that's half a see once these are in goes
up at all they're so staggered fuck this
chart fuck this chart has to here and
then a half one and a half one no a
hairdresser you're not helpful
most of these are so outrageously uneven
like the tape is like this I am like so
surprised how flat they lay though they
must be tired she was a roommate came
out Jennifer I like hit my head or
something I had to go to the doctor and
he went to go look at my head and it was
like bitch I can't move any of your hair
it's taped together that's crazy that
looks beautiful just don't look at this
car I feel amazing already look at that
look at this what this is fucking great
the color came out so good
come on can I have that back please you
can't hold grubby with two grubby
fingers my fingers as I use them the
gross anymore oh that's so fucking you
want to do this yeah you really yeah
pretty yeah
well they can see it's just my tie dye
roots you know you're doing yeah use
that depart for me and I'll pop it on
there
clapping clapping no no no no no no see
the word I don't want you to use when
you're gonna put a hair extension to my
hair is plop are you scared
please don't glue my hair all together
I'll pull it down are you saying what is
lined up oh you just squeeze it you
don't gotta press my whole head together
oh that came out pretty good Julie we
have seven like sandwiches left and I'm
just trying to figure out like I
obviously don't want to go too high can
you see any air you know I can feel them
but can you see them like I know a lot
of people stick them like up here but I
don't think I'm gonna do that yeah I'll
just tease this part or something if I
want y'all just can't even bail Prague
this is fucking beautiful
you see any of the trash blonde strips
of tape all right let me see what
happens when I pull my hair oh it feels
weird I don't like it can you see it
no there's the last one oh shit these
are the only like close ones to my face
these two don't worry I'll just pick
this one up off my dusty-ass floor it
was actually really fun like it was like
really relaxing to like paint all the
extensions parting my hair was a little
frustrating but overall it's been like
kind of a nice experience um I think
they came out pretty amazing
what that's wrong oh what a little bit
no now what you do is you just like
tease a little part of this so it sits
over that no Sharpie Julian this is like
dangerous this is so fun and like long
and amazing and I didn't have to send it
a hairdresser for eight hours I just did
in my house free though does look pretty
in the back I love how I came out thank
you I'm a little nervous about not being
able to shampoo or like touch my scalp
or really brush my head or like put my
hair up or in many different styles but
overall I'm very excited and I will
definitely keep you updated as to how I
end up liking these I get to go to sleep
and not have to like wake up and clip
them in or like when I'm ready to go to
bed like take them out there you know
they're in there fuck him in there yeah
I think the color came out like
shockingly / indistinguishable it's
really insane I really I was not
expecting that that's that's insane it's
so beautiful it's time to go to the
library now bitch I love it Julie do you
love it alright take bets when's when's
the first time I'm gonna lose one he
karma it's gonna be the one that came
out of my hair
