ah it was my birthday yesterday I turned
29 I'm very excited about it and I did
absolutely nothing i sat on the couch we
just got back from Australia we're
traveling for like 30 fucking hours so
we built it in that I would have like a
nice little day off to just relax and do
what I love most which is nothing I
loved every second of it and I'm also
like low-key freaking out on the inside
because I'm going to the streamys
tomorrow and I already know I'm just
gonna look a register felt me but it got
me a little bit sentimental my dad sent
me a very sweet package I had some
pictures of me from when I was a kid
every year that you get older you just
think a little bit about your life and
how far you come I am on level 29 okay
that's what I like to say means that
beat the underwater level and the
pyramid level like a winter all the
tunnels
I'm just getting better and better at
life and I don't usually make like
advice type videos but I'd be more than
willing to if you guys ever wanted that
I know it's requested often just wanted
to reflect on my 29 years on this earth
because that's how you get better as a
person if you don't ever reflect then
you just stay an idiot so here we go in
no particular order here are 29 life
lessons that I've learned in 29 years I
learned this lesson secondhand from my
neighbor when we were growing up his
kids she lived at the end of my street
and she had some gerbils that had babies
and one day I was like hey Hillary how
are your gerbils doing and she said bad
they're dead my brother fed them a
pencil and they died lesson learnt
Ellery don't feed your gerbils a pencil
because they will die this is a morbid
video Jenna off to a weird start I would
say who are you talking to me you should
always keep things that you might not
think are special now but you will think
are special some day I made a video
called what's in my special shoebox
where I go through some of the things
that have kept for years and years and
years and I'm so thankful that I have
because some of it's hysterical and some
of it's really sentimental that you
didn't ever think would be that way
for example I'll show you something that
my dad sent me for my birthday this year
my dad sent me my actual critter box you
can't even see that it says career box
you know we soldered it in there what
that thing is called and this was where
I used to put all my critters when I
caught them I'm gonna close that and
then I would look at a grasshopper or a
toad for your day and carry him around
this was all I did all day and you know
what this is probably one of the most
special things that I have as an adult
and I can't wait to give it to my kids
someday so they could be like mom what
the fuck is this shit keep stuff it's
awesome always have as many animals as
you can I always convince other people
to get pets I'm like pet pusher Oh sucks
man you got fired from your job you know
what you should get is a pet no I heard
you broke up with your boyfriend you
know you should get a pet I say as you
can for a couple of reasons but like if
a plant or a fish is the best you can do
you fucking water to shoot out of that
plant and you tap feed the fuck out of
that fish man it will help you as a
person to care for something that's not
yourself I also used to think the law of
diminishing returns applied to pets one
is like a shock oh my god it's a pet
it's a new in my life too is like oh
these are my dogs to live them together
three is like in with one more and so on
and so on but the late great Joan Rivers
taught me that if you have more dogs
than that and they create a pack and
they don't love you anymore true words
spoken by a true Queen and I used to
think that three dogs wasn't a lot of
dogs dear past Gina three dogs is a lot
of dogs a rock tumbler is exclusively
for rocks only don't put your sticks and
your dead grasshoppers in there and
expect them to come out all shiny it
doesn't work it just come out all fucked
up say yes to things sometimes even when
you don't feel like it not like that
okay I'm not saying anything like that I
mean say yes to experiences like when
someone invites you somewhere and you
really don't feel like leaving the house
say yes every once in a while and just
go do it because some of the best most
exciting memories I've made have come
out of from just being down and you're
saying yes this is a little bit of a
weird one I think this is only me but I
like to be the last person to go to bed
when I'm hanging out with my friends on
the weekend probably one of my most
favorite things in the world is to just
sit and chat with someone just have a
couple drinks hang out and just talk
about life and some of my most
favorite conversations with now some of
my most favorite people have all come as
a result of staying up very late and
talking into the wee hours of the
morning as long as you want to hang out
and talk to me I will always be there to
hang out and talk to you I will never be
the first one to say I'm gonna call it a
night and go to bed I promise you that I
mean that might feel a little weird but
to me those are some of my most favorite
memories that I have don't ever mix lots
of different types of spray-tan together
it turns into what I like to call a
tanning emergency Janet where are you
you're supposed to be here 20 minutes
ago yeah I know I'm sorry I'm having a
tanning emergency and I'm like spreading
brown goo all over my body and like
washing it like dabbing it and putting
makeup all over it and just turn fucking
brown and green in every color it's a
tanning emergency don't do it you don't
ever have to take your life seriously
but you should always take your
education seriously and your continued
life education seriously it's never too
late to learn anything in the world that
you want to learn and if you have an
internet connection you no longer have
an excuse to be a fucking moron it's
literally your choice to be an idiot
just because someone dares you to do
something doesn't mean you should
actually do it one time I liked bird
poop off of a bin and you know what I
can still taste it I'm also looking at
you all former contestants on reality
television shows don't ever get too
wrapped up in the present moment and
your present troubles have a little
perspective I've always been really good
at this like way too good at this like
in college I would try to convince my
softball coaches this one out get in
trouble for having too much fun and not
focusing and then everybody freaking out
oh my god well does it matter now
no I told you he did for me at least I
had fun the whole time you can avoid
many embarrassing adult moments by
learning how to use chopsticks at an
early age take my word for that you're
trying to impress someone while you're
eating with chopsticks oh yeah please
take me seriously sorry I'm an idiot can
I have a fork if you ever find an
abandoned shopping cart keep it
especially if you live in a city when I
didn't have a car it was the best
I would wheel my laundry to a laundromat
in it groceries beer we will
put each other in it wheel each other
around get hurt like some good cheap fun
you know what I mean we kept it in our
backyard like true resourceful college
students always be as prepared as
possible when I used to drive a really
unreliable car you know what I kept in
the trunk a tent canned food and all
kinds of other supplies Jenna that's
weird
I mean if your car broke down you could
just sleep in your car yeah but I used
to drive to a lot of really weird places
and I didn't have a cellphone I knew for
sure that I could just ball out in my
tent and survive for a few days until
somebody found me preparation is key I
never needed to use it but being
prepared never hurts that's why I also
kept like a crank radio in there
something like oh I'm gonna need to
listen to some tunes priorities don't
ever put gas or gum in your hair it
won't come out you'll have to cut it off
thank you older brother I'm still pissed
about don't ever directly inhale a bunch
of incense I used to be an altar server
and I was carrying one of those big
balls of incense and it just went too
straight into my face and I thought that
was it for me
well that's an earth I'm about to die if
you find something that looks like a
lighter in a room that you're staying in
don't try and click the little thingy to
turn it on it's pepper spray and once
you spray yourself in the face with it
to keep embarrassing you after the fact
while you're coughing and spitting
they're gonna have to evacuate the whole
floor because everyone else is coughing
and spitting - so just keep it in the
drawer and just don't touch it don't
ever eat a pound of celery in one
sitting I went through this phase where
every time I went out of town I was
determined to eat everything in my
refrigerator because I didn't want to
throw it out didn't want to waste my
money this is a bad plan throw it out
well good for you
not good for anyone except for like an
elephant I deeply regret it contrary to
my childhood belief Robert Redford is
not a president turned actor who's never
president he's just an actor I literally
thought he was a president and then I
got an internet connection I realized
how stupid that is don't trust cats or
ferrets I've had both I've loved both
and they're both shifty my ferret chewed
a hole through my window and got on my
roof get back here you shady bitch it's
probably not the safest thing to let
your kids play with power tools
I probably won't let my kids do it
someday but I got to do it it was
fucking awesome makes for really great
pictures to fuck with me I'll build you
a shed
Craigslist is actually the best place to
find roommates and friends for life it's
the friend of a friend of a friend on
Facebook that you have to be worried
about those motherfuckers are crazy
always find the humor in everything it
has gotten me through everything in my
life
breakup school family anything hard
that's happening always find something
funny to laugh about basically well my
whole channel is just me coping with
life by making everything junk like that
don't ever put up with people's bullshit
ever not even a little bit it never pays
off in the long run for you to just be
patient deal with someone else's fucking
shit ever never pays off it might keep
some people from wanting to be your
friend but that's okay because they're
full of shit ah I'm sorry I'm just I'm
having an allergic reaction to your
bullshit I literally can't feel my arms
when you're around me like glitching in
the matrix my body is physically
rejecting you just build a physical and
tolerance to other people's bullshit
acrylic toenails are gross literally the
weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life
why would you do that it's just no need
no matter how dope you think they are
don't ever wear loose shoes on a roller
coaster they will go flying off into
another dimension what's safe either you
probably that really hurts like a kid
it's fucking that's dark move on don't
ever let someone else convince you that
what you like to spend your time doing
is a waste for example 20 years ago
playing video games in your house by
yourself all day what's browned upon and
guess what ain't nobody laughing at
PewDiePie now mall fucks if you like
doing it and it's not harming anyone
else you should do it as much as you
want although maybe not if your passion
in life is like smoking a lot of cracks
get some help not good but any hobby
that you have you go do that hobby my
little friend I promise you it's not a
waste of time my hobbies include
watching videos of foxes jumping on
trampolines and talking to myself so I'm
waiting for that to pay off someday
hopefully soon there will be an Olympics
of talking to yourself I would get it
gold or a silver that's right who are
you talking to me don't ever have a pet
or even a baby if you don't like being
scratched it's just gonna happen I
wasn't aware of this information prior
to having a cat for the first time when
I was a kid valuable thing too
it will scratch you even now Kermit
likes to wake me up every day by taking
his claw and slowly dragging it across
my face it's lovely always talk to
everyone I'm a big believer that you
meet everyone for a reason and that just
having a conversation with someone can
give you something that you didn't have
before some knowledge some like thing
whatever it is my friends don't really
like this one because they've had to
pull me away from a lot of strange
people but I still like it I'm gonna
keep it and I will talk to you no matter
who you are or where you are or what
you're doing it's gonna get weird
and lastly probably the most important
thing that I've learned in 29 years took
me a little while because I didn't
always used to be this way but that if
you always put out positive energy into
the universe you will get it back it's
like if you just wake up in the morning
and you think about how grateful you are
to have clean water to drink and food to
eat the rest of the day you fucking easy
man just small stuff that you take for
granted the fact that maybe you're
healthy or that you have a family that
loves you focus on the things that you
have and not the things that you don't
have and always be kind to other people
and you will always get it back I'm a
big believer in the idea that you can
get anywhere that you want in life
without fucking other people over and
without being a jerk you don't have to
climb a ladder you don't have to compete
with people that you can just do the
best that you can and that is good
enough and I think that's where I'm
going to end the video cuz those 29
things that I've learned and it's also
getting a little preachy over here
Johnny you need to just take it down a
notch okay
I hope you got anything out of this
video even if it's just don't eat a
pound of celery I'm very sentimental
looking back on my life and things that
I've learned and I just want to thank
you for tuning in and for watching me
you know in a world full of thirst where
people are asking for your fucking
attention I appreciate that you come
here and you hang out with me and you
always treat me like a person and a
human and a friend I really enjoy that
and I hope that you enjoy it too yes you
I don't know what karma got me for my
birthday he was sitting on my shirt he
went to go chase a squirrel knocked my
iPad out of my hands and it smashed on
the ground
thank you courage does I see you're
paying attention to any small screen so
I break it so you have to pet me I heard
you can fix it by soaking it in a bowl
of chicken all very premeditated make
