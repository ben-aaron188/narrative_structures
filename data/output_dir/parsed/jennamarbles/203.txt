my ratchet salon hair looks better like
this though than it did last see say
that much my Falcon alright so this
video is been requested by a lot of
people but this is a tag going around on
YouTube called what's on my iPhone /
what's on my iPad this is the video I'm
trying to shoot last week and I was like
I'm not feeling it I think my problem
was I didn't want to just show my phone
like everybody fucking are you gonna
camera on your fucking pictures or your
text messages we get it okay and I liked
other people's but I wanted mine to be a
little bit different so it's probably
gonna be more of a what kind of apps and
shit I use so I'm gonna start with my
iPhone and then we're gonna move to my
iPad because I use them for two totally
different things one is for shit and the
other one's for shit no I'm not gonna
show you two and fucking naked pictures
to take on my boobs next time just
kidding it's never coming so this is my
iPhone ooh a monster case is a monster
and my background is Kermit wear a
turtleneck I use my phone mostly for
Twitter and Instagram for those of you
that send me messages and shit and never
get back to you this is pretty much why
this is my inbox is just full of shit
like pussy pussy pussy
anal my Instagram I use to basically
just fucking follow really really hot
girls and friends other youtubers and
more hot girls I just have girl crushes
please see the video girl crushes of
your confused as to why I follow so many
hot girls moving on I don't use fucking
Facebook on my phone at all ever I don't
even use it on my fucking iPad it's the
most useless app of all time it takes
way too long to load for some reason I
feel like every time I'm on Facebook I
look at my newsfeed and it's just all
the people I don't even really want to
be friends with and I just see their
life and it fucking bothers me I just
try and say it all the way away from
that day all the way away so I had this
fucking this ATT app on my phone because
I got a security system in my house and
be safe and use anyone wants to fucking
break in it came with a security camera
but I mostly used my security camera to
fucking just watch my dogs and they do
nothing I was so excited to get this
fucking camera and like see them doing
mischief and shit during the day and
they don't do nothing they lay on
couch and they sit there because you are
fucking lumps of lazy fuck alright next
app I like to use on my phone he's
fucking MyFitnessPal this is my fitness
dick is what I call it I can't stop
saying dick this is a problem hey Jenna
what are you thinking about I don't know
not dicks dicks dicks not dick I use my
fitness pal because it helps you be
accountable for the food that you eat
but also be because my trainer Jordan
Graham the fit boss on Twitter kee
fucking checks on me every day and oh I
see that you ate pizza Jenna here's 100
burpees fuck you all they just did an
update well you can adjust your macros

an egg it was like your cholesterol is
fucked for like ever
so they just fixed picks their dick uber
I fucking I love Eber so much I can't
even stand it it makes my heart hurt how
much I love Oberg on the contrary I used
to have taxi magic and taxi magic is
just about the worst fucking invention
of all time like if you get all dressed
up and you have somewhere that you want
to go on finding your Saturday night and
you want to spend the rest of your night
standing outside your house waiting for
a taxi taxi magic is the fucking app for
you it is useless I fucking hate it
you can get a cab and then it'll cancel
your ride you know you're sitting there
looking at where your cab is this I
thought your rides canceled fuck to get
another one and then ten minutes later
fuck they don't do shit fuck you taxi
magic I ought to hold your app on my
phone is your useless waste of space
snapchat I fucking hate snapchat I never
use snapchat it's still on my phone
Jenna why is it cell on your phone if
you hate snapchat ah because I have like
one friend that likes to snapchat me
she's in the army her name's Rachel
gestation Oklahoma and she always sends
me pictures of her life so that's why I
have snapchat that's about it I don't
fucking use I hate it too many dick

reason horoscope every day I love is

can someone love me Google Earth I don't
know anyone else of my friends that uses
Google Earth
I love Google art you know you zoom into
the ocean you like find this like cool
fucking archipelago violence and shit
and you click on it like the little
Wikipedia box I get really mad if you
find somewhere and they don't have a
Wikipedia box because all I want to do
is know what that Islands deal is 99% of
Google Earth I use four islands and 99%
of the time doesn't have a book a TV box

there and what their deal is and if I
can come visit them Pandora I use

of the only radio stations I listen to
on Pandora is the Will Smith radio like

Pandora captures the essence of Will
Smith radio this would be the only game
that I play on my phone
