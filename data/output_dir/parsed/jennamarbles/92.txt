welcome back to Jenna's ratchet fashion
salon I mean one of these in the past
and I don't know why anyone liked it but
like a lot of you guys liked it I was
genuinely baffled by it but why stop at
people closed when we can expand our
abilities into dog clothes I have some
twitter if you want to be make Game of
Thrones costumes for the dogs or Harry
Potter costumes for the dogs Harry
Potter one but I want to make a dragon
people are like Jenna why don't you just
make both and I was like what do you
expect me to make six dog costumes in
one sitting I am a mere mortal not in
crafting God and then I thought to
myself wait a second I'll just look the
difference so here's what I'm gonna do
Kermit is going to be Harry Potter
marbles is going to be Daenerys from
Game of Thrones and Paige is going to be
one of her dragons I feel like this is
the fairest way to do this to please
everyone so I'm going to show you right
now where all my inspiration came from
because they use the internet machine to
get some inspiration very ambitious for
today I'd say I've never made a dog
costume before so this could get very
dicey but let's do it okay first one I'm
gonna make is Marbles dress as Daenerys
for those of you that don't watch Game
of Thrones or race she's just a blonde
lady that has dragons so now you filled
in congratulations you're welcome I
think we should have like a gold collar
like her necklace sort of which is what
I got this for a long blue dress with
like a structured front you know so
there needs to be two arm holes and a
neck that's about marble size right
let's do it
cut some arms where I think Marvel's
arms might be but I know my bath time
for your fitting Wow this is not gonna
- is it I know you didn't consent at all
I'll call you back in once I fixed your
drafts okay so I made a bigger one
all right we're working with something
remove you velcro down here I mean this
is really really bad very good
patience Marple part of my strategy here
is to not show you everything until the
end so that I can have an reveal I
really don't want it so turns out making
dog clothes actually requires far less
selling that I anticipated
but I attempted to attach marbles
beautiful collar with his beautiful
dress and it was a terrible idea so I
just ripped it apart but thankfully I'm
only using hot glue I don't know why I
didn't think of this before because of a
person doesn't have to wear it just a
dog does I mean why am I even sewing I'm
gonna regret this the last part of
Marvel's outfit I wanted to be like a
blond wig but then I found this string
and I was like oh just make him some
yarn hair what if I chopped him up into
pieces and hot glued them to a piece of
fabric claps that point would be hot
glue this to these fabric and then hot
glue the hair to this this way will be a
lot better if it was like Halloween but
why wait for Halloween to make your
dreams come true
bouncing that's kind of it and do I need
his ears to polka uh looks like the
shape of his head right much to your and
my surprise this actually works
I'm chart laying it like your hair would
go this is the first row that's like
going to be closest to this face and
then I'm gonna lay more under there
hopefully it'll look like hair is it
overkill yeah is it gonna stay on his
head
probably not is it fitting for a queen
yes it is you know I realize it's not
exactly curly but working with yarn all
right
done with a hair now I'm going to start
working on permits outfit I think I'm
gonna do it differently than marbles
marbles like cut like the outfit first I
think I'm gonna do the collar because
it's like mostly a tie in a collar
fabric is very thin so I was thinking
about for the tie like actually using
this cardboard that it comes packaged in
you know that's kind of nice right I'm
just going to go like that and just hot
glue it to this I think you'll be able
to see the hot glue through it but like
what do you want for me it's a dog type
but I mean my inspiration is like really
high up there and the skill I don't
think we can accomplish that so just do
our version that's what the Internet's
for see something cool make a mediocre
version of it right
samus tie is done other's hot glued all
of the little yellow strips onto it and
yes I realize didn't make a little tie
knot but there is such a perfect
material so I decided Kermit was going
to be hairy for a couple of reasons one
because he's the only one tolerant of
wearing anything on his face and two
because this Cape is probably the least
invasive costume if he hates wearing
things on his body well very exciting
please work please work I don't have any
other ideas there is no plan B this has
to work all I'm going to tell you about
Kermit's glasses is that they're made
out of pipe cleaners which are no longer
pipe cleaners anymore they're called
chenille stems Oh fancy okay Queenie I
think yours is gonna be pretty ambitious
and we're just gonna do the best that we
can okay so I really need two
measurements made her body girth and her
neck earth better but so this is peach
hopefully my fabric markers will work on
here otherwise homegirl will be a white
dragon alright
it was a little bit of a process but I
think I have the pieces cut out the
wings of the
the neck piece this was the trickiest
part to cut because what the fuck is the
shape about so nowhere near as cool as
that one but hoping it's gonna work out
VG's off it is complete reveal time
alright so because Harry Potter won the
poll I think I'm going to reveal Harry
Potter first so ladies and gentlemen I
present to you Harry Potter corny you
look so hits the bud see that you need
glasses
so with a tie made out of cardboard and
caught-up fabric and more cardboard and
then a like on sale piece of black
fabric and some pipe cleaners this could
be yours
Wow the most tolerant dog in the world
oh you class the Sun that's really great
stuff Wow good for you
next up to the reveal stage Oh God
permit permit oh my next up on the
reveal stage
Daenerys Targaryen well pleasure having
you my BOB all right Wow pretty I mean
we could have made you a little
attachment under there but wow that hair
wearing a custom gown Wow mother of
dragons this is quite the look for you
Oh

from dragging around of doing stuff so
the mother of dragons needs to take a
nap right about now but look at this
