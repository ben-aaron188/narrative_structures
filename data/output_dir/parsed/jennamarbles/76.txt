you're not even ready about a year ago I
think I made a video called I suck at
pranks Julian likes to prank me a lot
he thinks it's very funny and people
always ask me to prank him back and I
tried one time and it was terrible but
awesome you know people keep asking me
to just keep trying you know the only
way to get better at something it's just
to try Julian's at the hair salon he's
gonna be there for a little while so I
was thinking of what I could do to prank
him and it's the end of August right now
and I want to prank Julian but I also
love Julian you know what would you do
for someone that you love in August you
would make it Christmas in August
good idea Jenna I like where this is
going oh I mean don't get too excited
okay I gotta execute it so when I was in
college I really wanted to decorate our
apartment but I didn't have any money to
buy decorations or like you know any
resources really all I had was just a
bunch of like old homework and papers
and stuff that I had saved because I
didn't use my laptop in college I used
papers and pens and shit I'm aging
myself here before all my roommates came
home I sat down and I took all my old
papers and stuff and cut them into
snowflakes and hung them from the
ceiling and they were like what is
amazing like a wonderland in here I'm
like I know I'm so good at decorating
and also being resourceful because I
don't have any money so what I wanted to
do is recreate that and try maybe like
dress like Santa or something and just
make it Christmas in August for Julian
when he gets home from getting his hair
done and surprise him and prank him so I
think step one I'm going to try and do
it in this room the ceilings are so high
like I haven't decided how I'm gonna get
snowflakes up there I should do a test
one first so I watched one youtube
tutorial and lost my patience and gave
up oh this is bad
so I'm going to try this method where
I've tied a string to the snowflake I'm
going to try and shoot it on the ceiling
so you know
oh okay so when this comes shooting out
the gun the string makes it all wonky
and then it's not a clear shot and it
won't
dick we got a rethink so I've new plan
Julian's gonna walk in the front door I
am thinking of sliding down the stairs
and some fantastic Santa fashion he's
gonna see this room and this room is
gonna be Christmas I'm gonna get built
in these snowflakes hopefully they'll
come out less shit than the last one oh
oh oh this is what I'm talking about
fuck you YouTube tutorial you just got
your shit wit oh no what I think I'm
gonna do with all my extra pieces here I
think I'm gonna put them all over the
ground and make it look like snow fuck
fuck fuck fuck fuck oh and your face
Julian what are you gonna do about this
you know what this shape is called
fucking pranked I'm just gonna do some
of this Yahtzee when's your wonder like
Julian got this like Lego set the other
day at the store and I think I'm gonna
wrap it up so that he thinks that I got
him a present for Christmas but I'd
really didn't he bought it for himself
fucking hooray okay got you all right so
this is where I'm at right now I know it
doesn't look like too many but I promise
you it's a lot of like snow I mean if
this prank doesn't get Julian off my
back once and for all
nothing will because nothing says don't
fuck with me quite like I just made you
a Christmas who is Santa Claus me don't
fuck with me I also just remembered that
Julian's half Jewish so we should
incorporate that somehow all right this
is Julian's menorah I know it's not a
perfect menorah okay and I did make it
out of paper but I'm running out of time
and it's the thought that counts
Happy Hanukkah I just wrapped Julian's
present looking like real fucking got
you in here all right so this is how the
ceilings looking found a wreath I pulled
the tree out of the garage and that's
Julian's shitty present but I can't be
bothered to open this and it also
doesn't work anymore
shitty Christmas about to happen
literally sweating time for smell oh
it's beautiful hey you want a Christmas
with me if I'm christmasing we're all
Christmas income here there we go that's
what I'm talking about giving the spirit
want to dress up like Santa Claus
have anything and it's the middle of the
fall Hodgins will get a costume right
now I found this I think I'm just going
to tie something white around my face so
I look like Santa and I'm gonna get a
comforter and slide down the stairs but
first I want to make it Christmassy in
here oh hell yeah this is what I'm
talking about Christmas is like I
remembered one other present I want to
give Julian it's a surprise he's always
