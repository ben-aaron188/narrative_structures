and he'd like some tape to tape my eyes
open and keep him up it for this entire
time I got back from VidCon I had a
great time thank you to anyone that came
and I got to meet you said Hasek I
wanted to lay back and just chill out a
little bit you know I'm saying because I
physically can't do anything except to
tape my own eyes okay so I was thinking
you know I guess I've made a lot of
videos like this they all just have
different titles they have like
different little bubbles of where they
belong I don't think that I've ever
explicitly said any like bad habits that
I have because I do have many bad habits
like any other human being I think you
guys seem to like these types of videos
where I tell you things I'm terrible at
so that it somehow makes you feel a
little better at life I don't have
anything too terrible or bad like I'm
not secretly addicted to crack cocaine
you know they're like little things it
really does help me when I put all of my
things that I want to change by myself
into the universe and then I change them
it really works you should try it
put your face into your pillow save them
at a pillow and it does the same thing
I imagine here we go feeling a little
vulnerable but here are my bad habits or
at least the ones that I could think of
I would say my number one worst habit
I've done it since I was a kid I
remember in third grade that we did like
fingerprinting and I put my finger in
the ink and I looked at my finger pray
and there's big like piece of my
fingerprint missing and my teacher was
like where's the rest of your finger and
I was like ah actually big part of it
off I don't bite my fingernails I bite
my fingers and I also like to pick at my
fingers
see how my thumb here how there's like a
big pink mark around it that's all the
years of scar tissue of me picking at my
fingers more like a nervous thing I
don't actually want to hurt my fingers
I'm hyper aware of it the second that I
go to squeeze a lemon very painful for
me but I mean I've been doing this since
I can remember so this is probably gonna
be the hardest thing for me to break in
the entire world I've noticed that the
only thing that helps is to get my nails
done cuz that I feel like the nails are
too pretty and I don't want to pick at
them but I'm kind of lazy so that's kind
of hard to do too and if I do my nails
myself it doesn't work cuz I'm like fuck
this man
and then I pick up my fingers it can't
help it because it makes me feel that
Ericsson nervous I'm just a nervous guy
you know my next bad habit is what I
like to call having the too much gene
and this could totally come from just
being an American which I find a lot of
people here have my too much gene isn't
so much like oh I need lots of
belongings it's more like would you like
another drink sure I'll see you Lana hey
you want to stay up for another three
hours Saturday of course I if we're
going takeout I'll be like you know I
should order some for a little bit later
from now because I know I'm gonna get
hungry again at some point eventually so
I'll just order something else little
now too so they can have it for later
I'll find a TV show that I like better
go ahead and watch the entire season
right now right now I have too much Jean
every single time I put on makeup
nothing about this is delicately done at
all you should see me try and put on
bottom mascara it's too much
I'll watch videos with people like doing
their eyebrows and like their mascara
and it's all very delicate and simple
and mine's like remember in my ratchet
fashion salon video when I made marbles
that little blonde wig instead of just
gluing some strands of yarn on there
getting the point across I spent like
two hours and glued hundreds of strands
of yarn onto that thing in the moment
what I'm doing something that's too much
I don't have any voice in my head that's
like maybe you don't need to glue that
700th strand of yarn into this wig
nobody's up here saying that to me
Julian hates this next one I have a
really bad habit of anytime Julia and I
are in a serious conversation or even
we're having an argument or something I
like to look at my phone during it so
help you like I told you to take the
trash out and I'll be like well I mean I
just forgot
so is it rude yes is it terrible yes but
in my own defense I feel like it makes
every argument just like a little bit
less serious while you're talking
sternly to me for something I'm just
looking at you so Briana
and then you know everything's gonna be
okay it's really not a big deal it
lessens the severity of any conversation
because I don't say things I'm like you
know in the heat of the moment because
I'm semi at of the moment I can
understand why it's thinking mad and
making it seem like I'm being very
detached but I'm helping us in the
launch such an excuse my next bad habit
is I got daily contacts which changed my
life because they used to have the ones
that you could change every two weeks
and they would get eyeliner on them then
I'd have to live with them for two weeks
and was miserable and awful and I got
daily ones a bad habit that formed
around that is that I can now get into
bed get all cozy my glasses are next to
me and like watch TV for a little bit my
contacts in and then take them out but I
sort of just put them onto my nightstand
because I haven't thought about like
making maybe like a little garbage can
or something for my nightstand that's
what they look like the next day I'll
pick them off in the morning but no
there's been a couple of times when
there's just like a bunch of dried up
contacts there in the morning is pretty
disgusting but you know what like I can
see and it's magical like who the fuck
invented contacts incredible invention
I'm doing what they would want me to do
I'm living my best life bad habit but I
mean if pretty awesome life's all about
balance I like to make fuckery chores
they're just like in everything drawer
they're the everything bagel of bagels
if your drawers are bagels so I mostly
have them downstairs where you have like
pins and like you know stupid stuff from
around the house you don't really know
where to put put them in fuckery drawers
and then the fuckery drawers turn
out-of-control gets the way where I
can't open it close to fuckery drawer
because there's too much fuckery in it
like just look at this oh my god
so maybe instead of making a fucker a
drawer I could throw them in the garbage
instead of putting them anywhere but
like I said in the past I don't really
like to throw things out because things
are so good why would I throw this out
and I'm also a goo hoarder so there's a
lot of goo in there like lip glosses and
chap sticks what if I'm like standing
around the kitchen
and I want to put on some chapstick
that's what the fuck are you our sport
there's not an appropriate thing to do
with your belongings and I know that but
I like fuck her a little bit of chaos is
good for your kitchen or your house not
a lot though I'm borderline too much
that's my too much Jean coming in
putting things into my fuckery door okay
it's not me it's 99% my problem I like
to leave my eyelashes wherever is
convenient for me Julien actually made
this a series on his snapchat where he
would take pictures of places that I
leave eyelashes that includes like walls
tables books the floor right now the
highest concentration of eyelashes is in
my office where my mail should go mmm
this is where my things go what am I
gonna do walk all the way upstairs and
put them back in their little case so I
can reuse them nah I'll put them here
then when I do eye makeup on calm
downstairs and get that which never
happens I have a downstairs eyelash
collection they're too pretty to throw
out right now but if I want to reuse
them just gonna toss them in the trash
give them a little extra life give them
some home whenever I hang things up on
walls I like to do it we're in a variety
and well please I never look for studs
it's also the worst plan ever if you
live in a place that has earthquakes
you'll learn pretty fast should not upon
that there this is your fault
I'm sure Julian would consider one of my
worst habits to be that I somehow refuse
to charge anything ever and never charge
my phone and I'll go into the office
take his mo fees charge my phone with it
like while I'm using it for something
and then just let them die and not
charge was mo fee and leave all of his
mokey corpses all over the house which I
understand is completely awful but I
just want to charge them
I will go to do the podcast or something
and all the headphones are dead and
don't look at me be like what the fuck
you've even plugged them in you left
them on you let the battery die or
thought they were charged I was doing
stuff it's pretty bad cuz
in the house is dead all the time
because of me what am i more annoying
habits is that I like to COO with the
dogs to the point where everyone around
me is so completely annoyed and I just
don't even realize it but I find that
they like Disney songs the best let it
go let it go like that until Julian
literally wants to rip my head off
they just need love if I don't commit
you who's gonna commit you I also
started a really annoying thing where I
count to ten for no reason make
everything excited about it one two
three four I'm the most annoying person
I'm a really bad habit about being very
nitpicky about not even the things that
matter in life just the stupidest things
in life ever I got I'm very particular
about how the bed gets me I have a very
specific plan what happens in what order
and where the pillows go where
everything goes and if it doesn't happen
that way I get very angry but you know
more serious things than life I'm like
yeah what can you do but that fucking
pillow needs to go there the rest of its
okay hey everybody just don't fucking
touch that or I kill you it's pretty
stressful hurt those around me I'm very
excited I'm working on it another
terrible habit that I have is that I let
my dogs do absolutely anything that they
want for example Kermit bites me at
least once a day
it's usually because I pet him when he
didn't want to be pet or trying to pick
him up and he didn't want it I let him
bite me and then I apologize to him for
bothering him with my affection and
friendship he would never bite another
person because he knows that he owns my
soul so he can get away with it he
doesn't even have his front teeth
anymore he just bites me with those ones
as I should have asked permission before
I pet you I understand sometimes I don't
want to get touched either it's my fault
I mean that's a terrible habit that only
breeds more bitey bad you're bad bad
they also step all over my boobs all day
every day which really hurts and instead
of trying to tell them not to do it just
lay back and say this is the reality
that I've
for myself I did this this one's pretty
bad if you know anyone like this because
I am that person I like to make drug
plans
yeah man totally I will definitely meet
you in Palm Springs tomorrow it's 6:00
a.m. I will be there no I've had Julian
interrupt me a couple times and be like
Jenna no drug plans I'm like fuck shit
you're right sorry I will let you know
tomorrow and I'm not drunk no drug plans
the worst is when I hang out with
another drunk plan maker and then we
make drunk plans together miss I have a
terrible habit of taking on things that
I can't really take care of like my herb
garden
oh all right he you did you did I really
loved it but like you're kind of needy
and I don't have time to trim you and
water you all the time so you're welcome
bugs I literally never carry my house
keys with me ever I get locked out all
the time
I hope Julian has it that's how I get in
and out I don't want to carry mine it
doesn't go with my outfit my last bad
habit when I asked Julian I was like
what am i bad habits you think I'll use
it oh you got to put in this one which
I'm not convinced as a habit at all it's
just a thing he says that whenever I
call a bunch of times in a row I sneeze
at the end how am I supposed to break
that or change that it's not a habit
it's just a thing it tickles my throat
it makes me sneeze okay goes something
like this like that what am I fucking
supposed to do are you happy I've hunted
in have you seen this dark yet I found
it no you did it yeah so those are some
of my bad habits I hope that it made you
feel a little better about some of yours
maybe it's something we're seeing the
world we all only had good habits it
would be weird and no one would sneeze
at the end of your cough and that is the
spice of life am i right I mean let me
know what your bed habits are so that I
can feel better too
we don't have to feel bad because I feel
vulnerable
do I especially like if they're funny
you get 10 extra internet point if it's
funny but not in buying are really funny
so I get negative 10 internet point okay
you know I'm gonna go yeah thanks for
letting me make sort of a relaxed video
this week I really appreciate it so does
my sanity subscribe to my channel I put
out a videos every Wednesday and /
Thursdays sometimes you know I'll see
