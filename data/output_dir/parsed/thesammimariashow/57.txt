so a few months ago well okay where do
we start I was like a hot like six
months ago maybe yeah maybe more so you
guys know that we go to the cinema a lot
and Jason is obsessed with this certain
strawberry sweet and and then they
changed it and I updated the sweets
through different ones like only United
well so no I'm sure look people make
serpents and so since then he's been
like oh there's still this type like
then it was good and then when when I
went to go and get my magazines they had
them in that corner shop saying yeah the
good ones that have him cinema say and I
found in my local shop it's a good day
so I bought whole bag of them I wonder
if when I'm gonna go back and find out
their brand you're just gonna buy them
in bulk I think the look and that way I
can take them myself to cinema I don't
even need to buy since in cinema
extra pressure I know I can you know how
