good morning beautiful people don't mean
my lens is open properly so i don't
think that makes a difference to hello
how are you doing today i'm vlogging
which is very exciting for you got lots
of stuff happening today first thing
that we're doing right now it's matt
over there Matt as a loving life right
now how happy are you Matt very happy
yeah Matt Matt's a little bit stress
right now what the reason that is a
little bit stressed is today we're sort
me out like final stuff for the new rap
music video which you guys will see very
soon and you'll maybe even see those
sneak peeks of it today but Matt is
trying to finalize a couple of details
and am just not going to pan really we
literally I literally got a phone call
minute you go Matt was just calling
these this company using my phone and
then I hadn't like a number i didn't
recognize called when i thought it might
be the company disposed to join answer
and he some answers and he get his that
yeah hello and the companies like oh hi
is Marcus there please and ice it's matt
owen ask who's calling and then he just
goes no I'm fine whom was like okay just
all good sir yeah good start to the day
today is a combination of and us sorting
out final final five environments with
their final music rap video stuff and
also Christmas shopping so there's two
things combined in one day which is
great you guys might even get a sneak
peek of some livers presents because the
people i'm getting presents for today
don't watch my videos so i might as well
show you i'm getting them okay so one of
the things i'm getting is you guys know
obviously I have my group of friends I
have friends yes we do a secret
something every year and we set a budget
I think this year it is if I don't do 15
or 20 pounds this year and we're giving
gifts actually on my birthday which is
next week sometime because we're gonna
be here for my birthday and
sometimes it's like you don't know it to
be get Jerry present or a serious prism
so I'm on not on the high street com
wait for it focus here we go I'm I'm not
in high shoot com this is eight pounds
and this is for one of my friends this
is who I'm getting my secrets and for
this is one thing I'm going to get so
it's a little coaster and it's a bit of
a joke it's like great dads get promoted
to granddad um it's a bit of an in joke
with him like when I hand it to him and
he'll just be like wow cheers yeah yeah
no no that's the first experience of
blogging you can see yourself second
prison that I am gonna get really hope
you don't watch I'm gonna tell you not
to watch this but um I know I'm gonna
def have done lunch rush I'm thinking
getting my dad a nice a really nice
light wash bag because I feel like it's
something that when you have a really
nice one it just lasts forever and I'm
pretty sure he doesn't have one no I'm
sure he has one not like a nice one so
this is what I'm thinking I really like
the brown leather and all I need to go
that way instead there we go that's what
it looks like I think that's just really
nice and I'm pretty sure he'll really
like that so so the joke present for my
friend for secret santa is like like
they're just a little joke then the
actual present i'm going to get them is
something that i think i've always
wanted one of these for ages and that's
not the reason i'm getting it just like
me oh I've wanted that by Jenny meaning
is a really cool present have you ever
have you guys seen those like it's like
a smartphone project so you can stick
your phone in there I've never like seen
in real life but I've seen them
everywhere and then it projects outside
like you can watch stuff if you're
watching me like YouTube video you can
stick it in and project it like on to
order something there you go that's what
it looks like you stick your phone in
the back here and then it projects that
out onto the wall I think that's a
really really cool present so I'm gon
get that one okay I'm also buying alpha
something online
not going to show you that just because
out of anyone even if I say don't watch
this you guys will probably tweak to him
or he'll watch it because Alfie's like
when I'm one fans who loves watching my
videos so he will probably definitely
see it but I am getting something right
now so but yeah not showing you saws but
telling you I've got about five presents
now they're all in my shopping basket
and I'm at checkout personally when I
shop online I always use paypal for me
it's a lot easier and I think a lot of
people don't realize that we pay how you
can like link your card to it so you
know when you want to buy stuff online
you could go on and you have to enter
your card details every time and it's
like a bit of a mesh well when you have
your paypal like you just put it in once
then it stores in it just honesty does
make it a lot easier like I genuinely
use paypal for like pretty much
everything online i have it for my
netflix account my spotify account and
my shoe shopping and when i make online
purchase because it is just easier you
can give us a stun what a stunt yeah
trying to stun yeah this is no Oh should
I show you want to try you're gonna try
to head middle of posting something but
I on my ready similar way or i surrend
ER technique news yeah I'm not letting a
little singer yeah you that's the main
stun no singing it's okay mama and then
bouncing my gosh just go maybe go a bit
slower yeah I did the same way what's so
um okay oh god wait two sides and sing
yeah I'm impressed photo ok back to buy
its stuff before we could go out and get
the rest of stuff the music video pay
