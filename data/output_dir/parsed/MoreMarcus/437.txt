someone had crutches you'd be the person
you've got to me it kind of going your
crutches why do people do that obviously
why oh yes food baby food baby that
looks incredible good happy okay guys
one of my favorite things in LA now I
think we do it because we're British
but I've always done it since coming to
LA literally every person you look at
you assume it's someone so the amount of
times we've gone to each other there was
this one guy yesterday we're at the
Griffith Observatory he was like looked
maybe 1% like Kanye West and I was like
oh my god Matt looks like Kanye West and
then that looked at him and he's like is
that Kanye right we realized this guy
was about 50 times heavier than Kanye
and had just like the slightest face
similarity that's him Matt as well was
just like I think that's Chloe grace
Moretz as I actually it's a complete
banged up I don't think she'd be driving
around in a van car but it's like you
just assume every person like oh who's
that person who's that person I'm going
on film with Connor in a minute we've
got a couple of out or not in a minute
what am I talking about got a couple of
hours um Matt's biggest obsession is
wanting to see laughs so excited it's
gonna be amazing
he's really keen for the Hollywood sign
yeah so I'm gonna drive him up - we're
just gonna wing it and try and like
going around and row
just get as close we can and see it and
he's probably gonna get really odd
though yeah that's the plan right now
and we have got on baby you should go
and love yourself
whoo I've got haven't I holdin on to
somethin you should go and love yourself
I think it's the hair cute the way I can
do for Seto's off oh baby you should go
and love yourself
whoa ought to be fair I am going to see
Justin on tour if he is looking for a
backup singer I could probably do that
for him yeah definitely wrecker yeah you
can get in touch with you orchid yeah we
watch this and then I see that and go
