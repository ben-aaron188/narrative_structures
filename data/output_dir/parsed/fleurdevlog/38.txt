shirt with my Victoria Secret like
longline bandeau underneath it this belt

whenever I say Topshop but just habit
lover and then my boot I'm not sure if
you go with this outfit they also from
Topshop I kind of like it and I kind of
don't like I'm not feeling my legs that
much at the moment like they're a little
bit pasty I just faked and uh-huh but
yeah what do you guys think do they go
to they not go to like the outfit cheap
I feel like I need some kind of clean
black boots but only ones I have are
these one or actually have two pairs
these ones are too much you match you in
my belt and then these ones are really
narrow at the ankle so they kind of like
curl for your legs a little bit I'm
going to go through these for the time

Anna seems to think what's the deal with
it it's like some kind of curated yeah

of this lipstick which is one of the
news sorry it's like really loud music

barn but I have
imitation of a lipstick amazing I think

you just never know but the girls are so
fun it was such a good group of girls
and we're all so different but actually
