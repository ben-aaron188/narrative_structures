good morning guys hello that so today is
ver day as the first would you like
doing like crouched down a little bit
cuz you can't know it's a wagon I like
to go yeah it's the first of July you do
today is the day run before if you guys
don't know beginning of the year I said
I wanted to organize a house mountain
rest from that stuff some guitars it
hey we today's a day at that bar we have
a little bit of a spanner to throw in
the works people don't know because I'm
not actually gonna be running it and my
excuse so far as I've gotten splints
good excuse which is actually true I did
have shin splints but I would have
manned up through that and carried on
training the real reason people don't
know why I'm not running my own half
mass in which makes me feel really like
guilty and craps to be honest but baby
you I don't know yet other people
running no no yet you will know by this
point if you haven't seen my main
channel videos we slash mediums in all
the hard work here a happy baby and so
I'm not running but we go over to film
it so he'll be really fun
I'm running Mike is running look at this
look at mosquitoes you she was fun wear
that t-shirt can't above a Superman yeah
yeah there you go
balls and then look at look at the
colored accents on the shoes and the
short and he's got a gin sling things
options matching watch geez I've got car
shoes I've still got my t-shirt on
guys and I'm going to be on my bike
cheerleading and what I also haven't
told the charity yet or you is that I'm
going to matching all of the donations
from today so everything's raised so far
I'm going to match and they don't know
yet so that makes a little bit less bad
amount on running it

a car everything everybody

knees we got two extra runners treat
course going to be running piglets going
to be cheerleading and squidgy Roo are

not running either we're going on the
tandem bike we're going to catch up the
runners I've got my really sexy rucksack

some tunes and we're going to try and
we're going to try and catch up with
them slightly worried about how out of
breath I am from cycling around this
little field but this is my very
technical music station but I think we
should have rented these instead
hahahaha these would have been awesome
so enroute guys and we just saw Mike
here oh he didn't even stop we was all
so quick and he's way ahead of others
but he also him an ally gave us their
boobs they're like we can't deal with me

through the goodie bag for the first
time I might do this on the floor
actually I'm going to run out of space
so everybody on the run got given one of
these awesome goodie bags the guys that
Eyler sponsored the race so they made us
the t-shirts and they made us the bags
and they also gave us some goodies for
the goodie bag

some really yummy snacks actually first
of all there's one of my brow timers and
my Flo loves lashes are like my two
favorite products from my I'll arrange

nut coconut almond butter some pop
some Evian water and then more info from
common feel so awesome little goodie bag
and I honestly had such a fun day I'm
definitely going to have to wash this
team boobs thing off at some point but
Lissy
Lissie actually ended up with a tan line
of team boobs which is pretty hilarious
she also just texted me saying she
thinks she's lost a toenail from the
race so I've got so much respect for all
the girls that came out today they're so
awesome I was so good that I couldn't do
it but I had the best time cycling
around and cheering for everybody and it
was just so fun like I said before there
still is time to donate so if you guys
want to do that it would mean the
absolute world to me and I'm going to
match all of the donations up to ten
thousand pounds so I'll let you guys
know how much we end up raising but
please please donate and be really
generous because I will match whatever
you guys donate so I'm hoping we can get
to 20,000 pounds which would be so
awesome because coppaFeel is such an
amazing charity and yeah they've been so
amazing organizing this event and they
were awesome when I told them I wanna
run and everything that she's been
awesome throughout the whole thing so
