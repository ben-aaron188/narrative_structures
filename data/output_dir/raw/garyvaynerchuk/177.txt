1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:01,561
- Leadership, and that.

2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:03,004
You know what's funny, I think this is

3
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:05,396
like the cliche Wednesday
after Labor Day, right?

4
00:00:05,396 --> 00:00:06,998
Like, today it's fucking real.

5
00:00:06,998 --> 00:00:08,148
You know what I mean?

6
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:10,129
♫ We're unstoppable

7
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:12,962
(inspiring music)

8
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:20,019
Just got out of, Babbet, you
got some of that footage?

9
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,019
- I got it.

10
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:21,981
- Yeah, just got out of
the leadership meeting.

11
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:22,814
Tom.

12
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:26,078
Got out of the leadership meeting,

13
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:28,373
bunch of the leaders got a lot done,

14
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:29,862
grounded, super excited about kind of

15
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:31,667
getting the fourth quarter underway.

16
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:33,348
Everybody kind of updated the rest

17
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:35,501
of the leadership team
on where they're going,

18
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,022
how they're going about it.

19
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:40,022
And I enjoyed it, really productive.

20
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,056
- [Lady] Hi!

21
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,607
- [Gary] Okay.

22
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:45,731
- [Employee] I've been
texting you about this.

23
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:47,250
There's a dex, the event--

24
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,248
- Yes.

25
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,579
- There's a ton of dropoff
after three seconds,

26
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,651
is the event really on--

27
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,218
- The ton of drop off after 30 seconds

28
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,783
based on videos that are
longer than 30 seconds.

29
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:56,421
There's a lot of fascinating little games

30
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,140
being played in the digital world,

31
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,415
I know Facebook's doing this,

32
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:00,864
the video was 33 seconds,

33
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:02,818
and the drop off happened at 30 seconds.

34
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:03,890
Do you know what I mean?

35
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,017
I almost feel like I
wanna write this deck,

36
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:07,023
you know how I do it?

37
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:08,258
Hey, I know I've gotten everybody

38
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:10,058
in love with long form, and that is

39
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:12,159
been some of our special source.

40
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,216
Sauce, but that's not in leu of short,

41
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:17,011
and there's a lot of
data supporting short.

42
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,255
- Well, and here's the thing--

43
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:19,088
- Is that right, right?

44
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:19,921
- Second from the video too.

45
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:21,531
- Great news, we just fucking filmed it.

46
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:22,779
- Yeah.

47
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:23,612
- Vayner Media.

48
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:24,965
I'm being dead serious, Vayner Media,

49
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,134
I'm sending you a deck right now,

50
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:27,380
this is the attached video.

51
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,464
- [Announcer] A few moments later.

52
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,297
- Have an awesome day.

53
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:38,425
So, series of productive
meetings off the bat.

54
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:40,087
What's the early theme of the day?

55
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:42,049
Leadership, you know what's funny?

56
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,658
I think this is like the cliche Wednesday

57
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:44,856
after Labor Day, right?

58
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,571
Like, today it's fucking real.

59
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:47,834
You know what I mean?

60
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,688
Like today, there's a lot
of fucking people around.

61
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:52,929
Like it got real, real fast.

62
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,041
We're here in Long Island City,

63
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,045
in the new Vayner Media Office,

64
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:01,854
and studio, 50,000 square feet of video

65
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:04,876
and audio producing and running counts of.

66
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:05,820
I'm gonna go work.

67
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,808
How you guys doing?

68
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:07,802
All good?

69
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:08,785
Hey.

70
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:11,318
- [Assistant] So we're
gonna get you into wardrobe.

71
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:12,151
- Amazing.

72
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,568
I don't know if I can have this.

73
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,644
I've done this exact talk on the road,

74
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:27,819
in these places, this is what I've done.

75
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,839
- [Director] We're gonna say it

76
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,498
and send it directly to them.

77
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,992
- I've been to Buffalo,
I've been to Foxborough.

78
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:35,206
And by the way, they
don't even play in Boston,

79
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:38,056
they play in a shit
city called Foxborough.

80
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:39,175
I just came out of makeup,

81
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:40,883
they told me I was beautiful.

82
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:42,340
But not beautiful enough,

83
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,775
but now I'm ready, looks like

84
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,358
they're setting up.

85
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:48,928
It's super weird that Vayner Productions

86
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:52,386
is filming me, we're on
the actual talent in shot,

87
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:54,696
so this is unusual, this is the first time

88
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,056
I've been excited about it.

89
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:57,066
It's triple meta.

90
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:58,280
We've got Ubab in here.

91
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,805
Own Vayner Production up in one.

92
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,115
And it's very, very.

93
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:06,480
- [Director] And wear it backwards!

94
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,047
- And they're like my friends?

95
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:09,087
- [Director] They're your buddies.

96
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,228
- All right, friends.

97
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:14,298
- [Director] And tunnel guys, quiet.

98
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:15,505
- Scene one, take one, mark.

99
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:16,422
- Here see.

100
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,088
Let's be honest, nobody cares that you

101
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,399
actually play in New York,

102
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:24,649
because we don't like unlovable losers.

103
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:27,540
Here's to you.

104
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,222
No level of success is gonna hide

105
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,917
a profoundly uncool UR.

106
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,038
Sorry about that.

107
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:34,379
- [Director] Okay
resetting, still rolling.

108
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,374
- What?

109
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:36,207
- [Director] Profoundly.

110
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:37,040
- What I say?

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,873
- [Director] Profounding.

112
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:38,871
- Got it.

113
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:40,772
- [Director] Okay, settle everyone.

114
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:41,920
- Your way?

115
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,020
That's not good.

116
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,268
- [Director] Resetting, still rolling.

117
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,686
- Super excited so far.

118
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,561
There's my production team.

119
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,417
There's the Vayner Productions team,

120
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,336
really enjoying working with them,

121
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,665
excited about where Vayner
Productions is going.

122
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:58,943
Working with clients, working
with a bunch of you guys.

123
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:02,114
You need film-work, we're the gang.

124
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:04,088
We're the fellas, we're the gals.

125
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:06,898
Yeah, we need to take a, of me sitting.

126
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:09,301
We're gonna make a
display, cardboard display,

127
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:10,915
and then we're gonna build it

128
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:15,592
inside of my library and
run the video on the TV's.

129
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:17,370
Do an event again.

130
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,378
- Never go, but I need to go.

131
00:04:18,378 --> 00:04:19,402
Last time I tried to go you told me

132
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:22,270
to go to his family's
for (mumbles) (laughs).

133
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,477
- That sounds true.

134
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:24,850
Tyler just got fired, guys.

135
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,999
Breaking news, Tyler Schmitt, fired.

136
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:31,582
For trying to sell liquor to his family's

137
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:33,305
Mount Clare store which I respect.

138
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,371
- A move that I think--

139
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:35,342
- Which I respect.

140
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,604
There's a move picked up for me,

141
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:39,536
only to be your own demise.

142
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,063
Listen, it was fun to have him around.

143
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:42,469
Remember Tyler Schmitt, we was a good.

144
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:43,491
- [Lady] He got fired.

145
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,324
- Yeah, he just got fired,

146
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,905
but it was really, he had a great.

147
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,222
Don't fuck with me.

148
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:49,963
He had a great run, fired.

149
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:51,960
- What's going on, man, how you doing?

150
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,028
- [Gary] Hey man, how are you?

151
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:53,861
- Good.

152
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,694
- [Gary] It's a real pleasure.

153
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,539
- How you doing?

154
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:56,372
- [Gary] Yeah, thanks for doing this.

155
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,205
- No problem, man.

156
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:58,038
- [Gary] Happy to connect.

157
00:04:58,038 --> 00:04:58,871
You well?

158
00:04:58,871 --> 00:04:59,704
- I'm very well.

159
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:00,537
- [Gary] Good.

160
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:01,609
- Yeah, I'm happy, my
cousin sent it to me.

161
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:03,943
You too, and I was like, ah cool.

162
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:05,091
Check it out, see what's going on.

163
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:05,924
- [Gary] Where do you live?

164
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:06,757
- Jersey City.

165
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:07,590
- [Gary] Oh yeah?

166
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,423
I love it, I grew up in Edison.

167
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:09,678
- Oh yeah, I did a little research,

168
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,499
I actually never heard of you before.

169
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:12,527
- [Gary] Well I appreciate
it, now, nice to

170
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:13,944
make your acquaintance, man.

171
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:16,447
- Yeah, yeah, I was like,
all right, Jersey Guy.

172
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:17,280
- Let us know if there
is anything we can do.

173
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,194
- Yeah, cool.

174
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:19,188
- Enjoy it, real pleasure,

175
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:20,162
thank you for doing it, my man.

176
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:20,995
Take care of yourself, say what's up

177
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:21,828
to your president.

178
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:22,661
- I will.

179
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:23,494
- Please?

180
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:24,327
- Definitely.

181
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:25,479
- Yeah, it's super important for you to

182
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,312
leave the part where he says,

183
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,337
I didn't know who you were.

184
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,531
'Cause you guys need to know that 99%

185
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:30,155
don't know exactly who I am.

186
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:31,331
That's the exactly the best part

187
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,505
of this whole fucking thing.

188
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:33,752
All of you worry about it making it

189
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,447
and this and that, you
never fucking make it.

190
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:37,220
This is a fucking struggle for everyone.

191
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,228
You never make it.

192
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,227
You're always grinding.

193
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:42,262
Bye guys, take care.

194
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,338
We should do a meet up right in here.

195
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:47,124
YouTube, what do you guys think?

196
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:48,843
Meet up, right in here,
show them, Bad Man.

197
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:50,435
We're gonna drop it
somewhere in the winter,

198
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,074
we're gonna do a meet
up, like a late night,

199
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:54,011
just do a fucking party.

200
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:55,033
Will we get arrested?

201
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,201
(pop music)

202
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,468
♫ I will follow

203
00:05:58,468 --> 00:05:59,789
♫ I'll follow you

204
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,816
♫ Deep sea baby

205
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,853
We wanted to use this
as a prospecting event

206
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,963
for the advisory board, right?

207
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:07,352
Is that how you heard of it?

208
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:08,185
Okay.

209
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:15,432
- Gary!

210
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:16,599
- How are you?

211
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,279
I need all the content support.

212
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,676
I need an Instagram story,
I need a Facebook campaign.

213
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,725
- I would say an office in Chattanoonga

214
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:27,658
is what I'm most interested in.

215
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:29,260
- Okay.

216
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,615
Just had an interview with Mickey Clouds,

217
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:31,649
been here for a while.

218
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,645
Good dude.

219
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:34,229
Runs our Chatanoonga office.

220
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:35,481
I'm a fan.

221
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:38,205
Just a strategic talk about the office,

222
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:40,040
the offerings, the opportunities.

223
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,789
The good, the bad, the ugly.

224
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:44,892
Also met with Kim Garcia
from Vayner Experience,

225
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:47,151
our events business is exploding,

226
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,899
4D is what a lot of you guys know about,

227
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,855
got a wine event that
we're gonna be doing,

228
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,962
some other events that we're rolling with,

229
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:55,107
so just a lot of good shit going on.

230
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:57,264
Now meeting with an old friend.

231
00:06:57,264 --> 00:06:58,569
Cool!

232
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,207
Fun day.

233
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:02,125
What was really fun part of the day is,

234
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,077
I was doing some content for a client.

235
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:06,563
The multiple takes I have to take

236
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:09,360
when I'm not in control of the verbiage

237
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,356
made me laugh.

238
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:12,439
(laughs)

239
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:14,715
All those different takes,

240
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:16,448
I don't know how Bavvin's gonna edit it

241
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:18,304
was super funny, but really just

242
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,175
enjoying the action of the city right now,

243
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,891
headed to the US Open with a client,

244
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:25,463
be fun to get a little tennis action in.

245
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,936
See one of the all time
greats do his thing,

246
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:30,055
Roger Federer, a lot of respect for him,

247
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,666
even though I'm a Djoker fan.

248
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,154
And just really glad to
be back in the grind,

249
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:34,815
and back with you guys,

250
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:38,274
really just miss you guys a lot.

251
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:42,379
Now headed to catch
downtown in New York City,

252
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,440
to hang out with one of my favorites.

253
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,951
You'll see.

254
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:49,211
♫ Only her, only him.

255
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:50,593
Distribution.

256
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:51,661
- Absolutely.

257
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:52,509
- Period.

258
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,239
- Realest of real things.

259
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,155
Streams to reality.

260
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:58,943
Everything we fucking
think about comes true,

261
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,252
so be fucking careful.

262
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:01,420
- Don't scare them.

263
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,300
- About who you offend,
because if you offend me,

264
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,082
I'm gonna think about your demise, bitch!

265
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:07,582
(Gary laughs)

266
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,841
- This hat is bitching.

267
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:15,582
- [Assistant] Yeah, it is. (laughs)

268
00:08:15,582 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Director] All right, here we go.
