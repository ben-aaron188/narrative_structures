1
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:05,700
- D-Rock hit his head, tough way to start.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,288
♫ We're unstoppable

3
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:10,121
what, are you sure?

4
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:12,350
First of all, it's so cray
to look back at 10 years ago.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,633
Yeah, the iPhone X, no.

6
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:16,654
I don't the X is exactly 10 years old.

7
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:17,610
More than 10 years ago?

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,849
Super fun to see that
clip from 10 years ago.

9
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:22,356
A little baby fat there, anyway.

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,446
Just jumped in to, you know,

11
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:25,069
kind of building off of the stuff that,

12
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:26,798
first of all, I'm in Seattle.

13
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:29,216
Gonna do a whole voice
day today, TechStars,

14
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:30,804
they have a voice incubation, TechStars,

15
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:34,673
one of the premier incubations
for the startup class world.

16
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:36,705
You guys have heard
about these accelerators.

17
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:39,358
Y Combinator, TechStars,
these are top players.

18
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:43,108
They take 6%, I think,
these days, five to the 8%

19
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:45,162
for the company to be incubated

20
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:46,178
and start another company.

21
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:47,560
They give a little money,
they get networked,

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,116
they get characters to come in and speak.

23
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,729
They do things of that nature.

24
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:53,208
A great model for a lot of
businesses over the last decade.

25
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,041
For me, super exciting on this one

26
00:00:57,202 --> 00:01:00,221
because I've stopped
doing kind of engagement

27
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:02,931
with these incubators in the
startup consumer-to-app world

28
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:05,970
but this one is specifically
focused on voice.

29
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,864
And if you've been following
me at all, I like voice.

30
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,160
So I'm heading there now,
gonna do a fireside chat,

31
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,883
and then I'm going to do consulting

32
00:01:13,883 --> 00:01:15,990
for eight, or nine, or
10 of the companies,

33
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,635
then head back and just
get a lot of work done

34
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:20,399
and then head out to
Boise, Idaho for a keynote

35
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:21,902
and then head back home and do a bunch.

36
00:01:21,902 --> 00:01:23,661
But, I'm excited about getting my hands

37
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:26,578
a little bit dirtier in that world.

38
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:30,102
I got something for the blog.

39
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:31,329
You're recording, right?

40
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,486
Good, so you'll even see the transition.

41
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:35,434
This is Patrick Givens.

42
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:37,053
What's your official title?

43
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:38,548
- VP of VaynerSmart.

44
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:39,381
- Of what?

45
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,356
- VaynerSmart.

46
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:44,866
- So VaynerSmart, this may
actually have to be the episode

47
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:47,418
because this is something
that I will not embark on

48
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:51,647
as a pillar very often,
and I think Patrick's story

49
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:52,886
can help so many.

50
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:54,432
Let me explain.

51
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,905
I invested in a company,
internet of things, right?

52
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:00,450
Your bottle talks to you,
ah, I'm running out of water,

53
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,500
you can use me for this.

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,700
Just, where the world's going, right,

55
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,079
we're here at an incubation around voice.

56
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,463
This is not mobile, this is not social,

57
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:10,208
this is what I've been
in for the last decade.

58
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,932
Three years ago we started
three or four one-man,

59
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:16,529
one-woman divisions in
this bigger company.

60
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:18,979
Patrick comes over from another shop.

61
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,045
I was really impressed with him.

62
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:22,755
Kind of hired him pretty
quickly, on the spot.

63
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:25,518
And it's about his story, so VaynerSmart,

64
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:28,382
internet of things is
really where we started.

65
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,629
A lot of our work now
is in the voice space.

66
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,237
Not necessarily a direct
line to that, but indirectly.

67
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,224
You know, this term
intrapreneur, you know,

68
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:41,221
being entrepreneurs within
companies, I'm skeptical to it

69
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,495
because I'm so overly romantic
about entrepreneurship.

70
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:45,682
It's interesting.

71
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,702
I think you probably
represent one of the best,

72
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:50,401
if not the single best,
version in the seven,

73
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,365
eight, nine-year history,

74
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:53,632
eight-year history of VaynerMedia.

75
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,430
Patrick was thrown in a one-man team.

76
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,722
No admins, no experience.

77
00:02:57,722 --> 00:02:58,555
- Before we get started, I just want to--

78
00:02:58,555 --> 00:02:59,905
- I'll finish in a second, one second.

79
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:00,738
- Igor--
- Igor

80
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:02,129
- pleased to meet you.
- It's such an honor, man.

81
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:02,962
- Yeah, great meeting you

82
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:03,795
as well.
- Take care.

83
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:04,776
Thank you, such a pleasure.

84
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,259
So while he's introducing,

85
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:10,982
Patrick made it through
this system, stayed alive,

86
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,140
actually, that's so funny.

87
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,127
You know what he did?

88
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:16,277
He stayed alive until it got good.

89
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:17,521
We'll go into details later.

90
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:20,107
Listen, if your idea
is stupid, like, right,

91
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:24,087
if your horse is like a
horse on those machines

92
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:25,988
you put the quarter in, you
gotta actually run a race,

93
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:28,071
you're gonna lose.

94
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:32,045
But, it's stunning how
important the CEO is,

95
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,395
how important she and he is.

96
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:34,918
It's just, it's stunning.

97
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:36,190
So how we doing so far D-Rock?

98
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,433
Like, we're a week in to the
new style, what do you think?

99
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,400
- [D-Rock] I feel great.

100
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,808
I feel like we're evolving a lot.

101
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,730
We're having a lot of different thing.

102
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,045
- [Gary] Some good, some
bad, some indifferent?

103
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:44,991
- [D-Rock] Yeah, learning.

104
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,626
- [Gary] Learning.

105
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,825
Always be learning.

106
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:50,899
- [D-Rock] So, the last time
that I didn't read back in.

107
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:52,202
- What about if I ask
the questions right now

108
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:55,598
and you edit it as if I'm
not right there, right?

109
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,029
So we're about to interview Patrick Givens

110
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,203
who's the VP of VaynerSmart.

111
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:01,802
I think he's a uniquely
interesting person for you guys,

112
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:06,061
YouTube, because he won
within our organization

113
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:08,285
and a lot of you work in organizations

114
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:09,788
and you have entrepreneurial spirit,

115
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:11,129
and you're not ready to leave.

116
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,292
So maybe how do you act
like an entrepreneur,

117
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,985
AKA an intrapreneur, inside
of your organization?

118
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:18,672
- I think my whole approach to it was run

119
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:21,836
as thin and as hard as I
could for as long as possible.

120
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:24,355
The point of that was to have low overhead

121
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:27,516
and to be able to do whatever
else on the side I could

122
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:31,275
to make sure my group was
not dragging things down

123
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:33,173
while we built our capabilities up

124
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,489
so that when the market was
ready, we were ready to jump.

125
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,411
- I really wanna continue
to inspire you guys

126
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,142
to take the voice space more seriously.

127
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:42,601
I mean, I slipped here
into Seattle for it, right,

128
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,957
so I'm not in the business of like

129
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:47,901
flying places for free just 'cause.

130
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:48,919
I think it's strategic.

131
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,210
So anyway, back to Patrick.

132
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,864
This interview is to get his
perspectives on how to win

133
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:58,164
within an organization
and the voice space.

134
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,363
- I know where Gary's heart
was and where his head was

135
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:01,455
in this space.

136
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:05,570
I knew he saw the IoT space
being important and growing

137
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,256
as a place where a lot of his attention

138
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:08,723
was gonna move from consumers,

139
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:10,310
and where his clients need to be.

140
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,309
I see so much opportunity to build

141
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,250
new kinds of interactions here,

142
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,754
so we're in the first
half-step of what's gonna be

143
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:21,732
a really long journey on
voice, and it's cool for me

144
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,797
to start playing already with ways to hack

145
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,964
what's still a new system.

146
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:30,573
I love going in to meetings
with clients right now,

147
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:32,786
or internal teams, and being asked

148
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:34,410
what the best practices are.

149
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,769
And we immediately will say, look,

150
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,070
here's a few things that work in voice,

151
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,553
here's why they work,
but anyone that tells you

152
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:42,223
they know a best practice is
full of shit at this point.

153
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:43,393
We haven't even been here long enough.

154
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:45,587
No one's tried enough
things and failed at them

155
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:47,056
to prove out the ones that work.

156
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,980
So, we're super early, we're hacking,

157
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,208
we're playing in the space,

158
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,272
and that's the most fun place to be.

159
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:54,538
- They don't want anything,
so what's gonna be,

160
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,196
no, no, we can film everything.

161
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:57,159
The whole thing's gonna have

162
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,805
a Russ song over it, or whatever.

163
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,998
Find somebody who's got
a song named Patrick.

164
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:01,975
Patrick, you signed up for

165
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,467
the Gary V wine of the month club?

166
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:04,300
- [Patrick] Yes, sir.

167
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,896
- You got your email confirmation tonight?

168
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:07,320
Just now, you, Phil?

169
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,254
You haven't signed up yet?

170
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:09,087
- [Phil] I haven't signed up yet.

171
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:10,105
- But you will, right now, right?

172
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:10,938
- [Phil] Okay.

173
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:11,771
- Thank you.

174
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,604
- [D-Rock] Phil signing up?

175
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:13,437
- Yeah, it makes me happy.

176
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:14,760
- [D-Rock] Phil, you're signing up?

177
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,888
- Absolutely.

178
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,168
- [D-Rock] Good job, bud.

179
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,286
- Are you signed up, D-Rock?

180
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:19,209
- [D-Rock] Not yet, I'm going to--

181
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,139
- Well, don't, no, I know you did, no, no,

182
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,039
but let me give you a good idea.

183
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,135
Take it out of your phone right and do it.

184
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,751
(all laughing)

185
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:27,083
I was quick.

186
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,583
No, really, it's a great idea.

187
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:32,671
- Were you caught up for a second, Phil?

188
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:33,869
And did you get an email confirmation now?

189
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:35,169
'Cause I don't know if
they started doing that.

190
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:36,542
Coming to super tasting?

191
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:37,578
Can you make it?

192
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:38,948
Pub, because I can see
you weren't planning on--

193
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:42,632
I wanna really have fun,
no, it's gonna be fun.

194
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:44,219
♫ Wine, wine

195
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,816
- [D-Rock] All right, all three of you,

196
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:48,527
how is the start of your day?

197
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:51,386
- I mean, this was super exciting for me.

198
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:54,401
Feels very early, social media reminded me

199
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:58,648
that I can still play in
the tech space and be smart.

200
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:02,264
And incredible founders with clear vision,

201
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:04,734
and a different energy because
when you're selling something

202
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:08,714
that the world hasn't bought
yet, you're a different animal.

203
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:12,381
But super easy selling
social media and mobile now.

204
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,958
Selling the future of voice

205
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,183
as an infrastructure in our
society and how it interacts

206
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:17,790
is a totally different game.

207
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,704
Enjoyed it tremendously, and
a lot of you are watching,

208
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:22,138
and a lot of you wanna be YouTube stars,

209
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:25,084
and a lot of you wanna do what I've done.

210
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:29,014
And I always say, you know,
watch what I do, not what I say.

211
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:32,674
If you're just a curious kid,
go deep into this voice space.

212
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:37,036
I wanna use this moment in
my vlog to have those moments

213
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:39,117
eight years from now that make so happy

214
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:40,519
because I get an email from you

215
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,555
that you just sold your company

216
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,488
for 713 million dollars

217
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:46,678
to Google because you
literally watched this vlog,

218
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:48,425
you went out and took the time,

219
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:51,209
and the 40, 80, 150
hours to learn the space.

220
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,769
You got an internship at a startup.

221
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:55,543
You learned something, started something.

222
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,623
This moment can be the seed
of the rest of your life.

223
00:07:58,623 --> 00:07:59,893
Take advantage of it.

224
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,194
- [Man] Gary, thanks.

225
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:02,027
- Take care, man.

226
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:02,860
- It was nice meeting you.

227
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,335
- Real pleasure, looking
forward to jamming together.

228
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:05,168
- That would be awesome

229
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:06,001
- Good luck, take care.

230
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:06,834
- Thanks guys.

231
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,615
- Real good day, real good.

232
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:11,198
I wanted to remember it, voice.

233
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:13,858
Comment of the day on YouTube,

234
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:16,938
comes to you live from Seattle.

235
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:19,925
Huh, Andrew Hazzlee says,
you finally convinced me

236
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,092
to get back into Snapchat.

237
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,423
I don't know what, I haven't
watched the episode yet.

238
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:26,764
I don't know exactly what I said,

239
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:30,099
but I know exactly what I said, which is

240
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:32,508
there are practitioners and
there are headline readers.

241
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:35,847
And as a practitioner of content
creation and distribution,

242
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:39,711
Snapchat is a phenomenal place
to be a marketer right now

243
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:42,059
if you care about people under 35.

244
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,285
If you're a stock person, and Wall Street,

245
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,904
maybe not so much.

246
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:48,821
If you're a person that
just lives and reads

247
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,106
one thing at a time, maybe not so much.

248
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:54,343
But, as a practitioner that
wants to run businesses

249
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:57,045
and get shit done, it's phenomenal.

250
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:59,545
(tense music)

251
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,077
- [D-Rock] Hey Phil, what'd you think?

252
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,006
(all laughing)

253
00:09:10,006 --> 00:00:00,000
- Yes.
