1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,568
- This is awesome.

2
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,516
Let me get my angle.

00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,936
- Saba, I've been telling you.

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,364
- [Gary] You're my 
fucking idol, Gary.

6
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,833
I just found you last night. 
(group laughter)

7
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,870
The competition 
for that idol spot

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,772
must've not been that tough.

9
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,270
Hey Mumoya.

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,576
I'm great, Mom. 
How are you?

("Goals" by Cartel)

12
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:46,912
I'm in Belgium.

13
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:48,749
Know what I've 
been doing on Facebook?

14
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,893
Did you hear?

15
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:55,722
I've been converting my videos
into other languages so now

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,525
people who only speak Russian
can watch the videos and see

17
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,909
them in Russian.

18
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,131
They can (speaking 
Russian) in Russian.

19
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,202
Hello.

20
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:08,335
I had to stay up so late.

21
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,271
So I'm on from 3 to 4?

22
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,034
- [Sam] Yes, 3 to 4 and then
you have the book signing.

23
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:14,770
- Uh-huh.
- [Sam] You'll do that on stage.

24
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,379
- And that's gonna 
take a good hour, right?

25
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:17,621
- [Sam] We're gonna do 
that in a half an hour.

26
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:20,676
- No selfies.
Yeah, we do.

27
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:22,368
What time is dinner?

28
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:23,841
- [Sam] We leave here at 7.
- Yep.

29
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:27,614
- [Sam] We're there at 7:15.
- Maybe 10.

30
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:28,301
- [Sam] Yeah.

31
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:31,144
- 10 to 11. 
Alright Belgium, you won.

32
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:32,576
Alright Belgium, 
I have good news.

33
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:34,094
We're gonna do a meet up.

34
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,862
He gave me permission.

35
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,898
DRock, gave me permission.

36
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,866
So we're doing it. 10 o'clock.

37
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,236
10 P.M. tonight. 
Details coming shortly.

38
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,782
Will announce 
location at 7:30, right?

39
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:49,202

(crashing sound) oh!

40
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:50,522
Shit.

41
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:52,446
- Wow, that was.
- You didn't catch that.

42
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,626
(group laughter)

43
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:55,366
That was literally 
the best thing that's

44
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,766
happened in 168 
episodes or whatever we're at.

45
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,954
163, you missed it.

46
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,789
Good morning, east coast.

47
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,634
Sorry if I woke 
you up west coast.

48
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:07,828
We're very well into 
our day here in Belgium.

49
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,741
Doing a meet up tonight.

50
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:10,964
Say that, I like that.

51
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:11,813
- [Sam] Antwerpen.

52
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:14,668
- [Gary] Antwerpen 
tonight 10 P.M. Belgium.

53
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:20,040
Pass this on, tag in the 
comments all of your Belgian

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,844
friends and your 
western European friends.

55
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,880
Getting focused here in Belgium.

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,695
Really excited about this event.

57
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:29,549
Longtime friend, 
we've known each other.

58
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,350
What, six years?
- Yes.

59
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,018
- Seven?
- Seven.

60
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,452
Ten, that was 2006.

61
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,429
- No, no, I 
wasn't at that one, no.

62
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:36,923
- You were there. 
It was a snowy one.

63
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,458
- I don't think it was six.

64
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,159
- We'll find it out.

65
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,628
- Let's make a bet.
- What's the bet?

66
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,364
- $400,000 cash.
- Okay, perfect.

67
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,872
(group laughter)

68
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:50,464
- It can't be 'cause I started
Wine Library TV February 2006.

69
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:51,161
- Okay.

70
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:54,808
- So at minimum, it's 2008.
Minimum and it's probably 2009.

71
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,976
Believe it.
- Okay. Yeah?

72
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,859
But then I will owe you a lot.

73
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,015
- Euros, by the way.

74
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:03,083
(group laughter)

75
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,252
Yeah, just getting 
focused. Getting ready.

76
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,570
I'm in an 
interesting zone lately.

77
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,733
I think the last two talks I've 
given in Canada and in Ireland

78
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,595
maybe I need to start 
talking outside the U.S.

79
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,963
I think I found a new cadence.

80
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,900
This one should be fun 'cause
my friend here has very much

81
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,070
adapted into the thesis that
I've been talking about for the

82
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,943
last decade and has made 
some noise in this market.

83
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:29,238
This market's 
different, obviously.

84
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:32,913
You know, the Snapchats and
Instagrams of the world are at

85
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,781
the cusp, just emerging.

86
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,551
Twitter has not been 
able to grab a foothold here.

87
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,854
It is a Facebook environment but
as we were yapping incredible

88
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:45,625
amounts of direct mail 
investment which is crazy when

89
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,294
Facebook is so good at and that.

90
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,095
So we'll go there.

91
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:51,731
I'm gonna probably 
do quite a bit of Q&amp;A.

92
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,701
And so, the last couple talks
have been very entrepreneur,

93
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,105
very philosophical, very
emotional intelligence very much

94
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,899
works for, what is that?

95
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:03,223
- [Sam] 2010.
- 2010.

96
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:06,257
- Yeah.
- Yeah, €400,000 yeah.

97
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:10,017
(group laughter)

98
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,471
Yeah, so we'll 
see where it goes.

99
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:13,520
I think this one will go 
a little bit more tactical.

100
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,057
The details of marketing more so
than kind of the philosophical

101
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,392
places I've been able to take
the last couple talks which will

102
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,894
get more tactical 
and it's great, right?

103
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,730
That is in itself clouds 
and dirt and so we'll see

104
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,397
where we want to go.

105
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,601
This is a perfect example of
where I want to do more Q&amp;A

106
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,004
'cause I want to be able to
answer a very direct question to

107
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,941
the audience and so it's a
smaller group which also lends

108
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,810
itself to an 
intimacy that I enjoy.

109
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,115
It's so funny for me how much

110
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:43,435
I enjoy both 18,000 people in

111
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:47,739
Lisbon and 10 people in a
conference room like we did

112
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:51,699
yesterday in Ireland before 
the main stage and everything

113
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,260
in between and 
this is in between.

114
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,714
It's a warm crowd.

115
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:59,533
And so, I mean warm in the fact
that they have a lot of emotion

116
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,534
and relationship to him.

117
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:05,605
He has that for me so 
it should be really good,

118
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,673
really great day here.

119
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,210
And gonna do a meet up 
later which is exciting.

120
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,845
They've really put me to work.

121
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,014
Let me sleep a little bit but
that made me put me to work so

122
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,983
this isn't my normal 
one hour in and out.

123
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,653
They've got seven to ten 
fucking different events.

124
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,387
Sign books.

125
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:23,190
Library! Thank you so much.

126
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,591
What's your name?

127
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,026
Good. Makes me so happy.

128
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,471
Oh, I love it.

129
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,502
DRock, get in here.

130
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:32,354
Enjoying it?
- [Man] Absolutely.

131
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:33,339
- [Gary] Awesome.

132
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:34,245
- [Woman] So nice 
to meet you, Gary.

133
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:35,979
- What's up vlog?

134
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:38,094
- [Woman 2] Thanks, 
it's been enormous change.

135
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:39,240
- Separate sponsors.

136
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,228
- [Man 2] In 
Belgium we have a saying,

137
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:41,275
I don't know if it's in English.

138
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,127
The high trees 
catch the most wind.

139
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:45,866
- Hmmm, I love it. 
And I will be until I die.

140
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,691
- [Man 2] Yeah.
- I will always innovate.

141
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:49,482
I have too much 
confidence to worry about

142
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,717
whatever people think.

143
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,253
All the upside 
is being a pioneer.

144
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,580
I want to be the highest 
tree with the heaviest wind.

145
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,548
(audience applause)

146
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:07,332
€400,000.

147
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:10,012
Hey guys.

148
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:11,805
Yeah, thank you for having me.

149
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:15,198
What I don't understand, I don't
care if I'm right or wrong,

150
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:17,911
I'm just blown away that
you're willing to not find out.

151
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,547
We just sit with our 
thoughts and theories of

152
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,581
what's tried and true.

153
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,085
Let me tell you something, what
got you here today is not gonna

154
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,053
get you to the next place.

155
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,224
And we sit in theory and we sit
in romance and we sit in how,

156
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,160
you know how many people in this
room make business decisions on

157
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,296
how they wish the 
world was working?

158
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:39,479
The market is always right
not your fucking ego

159
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,235
and I got nothing but ego.

160
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,505
But when it comes to the
market, I only have humility.

161
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,747
The market is always right.

162
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:50,310
And we sit in ivory towers
thinking we're super fucking

163
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,113
smart and we disrespect 
the market every day and

164
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,581
that's why we lose.

165
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,538
In last year's fiscal year

166
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,688
96% of the 
Fortune 500 companies in

167
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:05,725
the world lost market share.

168
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,761
They lost market share because
they're marketing like it's

169
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,112
2005, they're 
marketing like it's 1997,

170
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:12,699
they're 
marketing like it's 1984.

171
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,467
That's why they 
lost market share.

172
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,037
And I know this because there's
only one other time that we have

173
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:22,425
seen this big of businesses lose
this much global market share.

174
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:26,079
It was the late '40s and early
'50s when the world transitioned

175
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,715
from radio to television.

176
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,352
My friends, we are transitioning
from television to this.

177
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,887
It's already happened.

178
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,822
I've been here for a long time.

179
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,200
I implore you to join me.

180
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,095
Thank you.

("Still Waiting" by Jura Kez)

182
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,811
Which one do you like the best?

183
00:07:55,811 --> 00:08:00,184
Forehead, left side

184
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:03,474
or across the face?
(Gary laughs)

185
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,286
Just completely crushed it.

186
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:09,140
It's like slayed it in Belgium.

187
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,692
This guy slayed it.

188
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:14,590
More than this guy 
and more than this guy.

189
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,029
I'm so competitive 
for no reason.

190
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,997
These are such nice guys 
and they're like right here,

191
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,332
I'm like, 
"You're such a good man.

192
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,667
"You're my best 
friend," and then I'm like,

193
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,801
"Fuck you, I'm the best."

194
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,070
By the way, most your 
clients agree with you.

195
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,274
Like in their brains, they know
what's going on in the world.

196
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,010
It's just that their 
modeling mix internally or their

197
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,948
reporting internally doesn't
justify the spend with you guys

198
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:38,451
and more importantly, there's a
dirty little secret that isn't

199
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,154
talked about enough which is
that marketing takes the credit

200
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:45,125
and is to blame for business
results often when it has

201
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,760
nothing to do with the business.

202
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,061
And so, they're scared.

203
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:52,298
So the answer is he, unless you
got the balls to pull it off,

204
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,797
needs to go to the 
CEO or the board and

205
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:57,174
get it pushed down from the top.

206
00:08:57,174 --> 00:09:00,018
You need protection to innovate.

207
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:00,960
That's it.

208
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,852
No different than the answer 
I gave the kid that sitting in

209
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:06,428
your seat, like, I wish I
could give you better answer

210
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,723
but that's it.

211
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:10,358
Either the most senior person
gives you the air cover to get

212
00:09:10,358 --> 00:09:13,839
it done or you wait and

213
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,969
in between you find the little

214
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,676
scraps of opportunities 
that you guys have found.

215
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:21,062
Just like me.

216
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:22,556
You need examples, you know.

217
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:26,562
For example, 
you need to put your money

218
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:27,602
where your mouth is.

219
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:30,800
You're getting bigger, maybe
you go to a local business.

220
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,425
Maybe they're a friend or
relative of one of you guys and

221
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:34,353
maybe you don't charge them.

222
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:35,216
Maybe you put up the money.

223
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:38,806
Maybe you put up 
$25,000 for the pizza shop,

224
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:42,575
do it, record it, show them.

225
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:44,357
One step backwards, 
three steps forward.

226
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:45,576
It's always the same thing.

227
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:50,489
Pictures, videos, 
words, sounds until we die.

228
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,837
Until the robots take over.

229
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:55,043
Where is what changes.

230
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:57,764
80 years ago, 
100 years ago people said

231
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,956
you're not being social.

232
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:00,105
You don't use a telephone.

233
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:03,278
You go to the man's house and
you shake his hand and you sit

234
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:05,314
down and you talk.

235
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,855
People were upset 
when letters were invented.

236
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:13,559
They were.

237
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,819
You're supposed to go 
over to their house and

238
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:16,268
draw on their cave.

239
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:17,814
(group laughter)

240
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:21,753
From 16 to 23, 
I always had $1,000 on me.

241
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:22,690
Always.

242
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,474
- [DRock] Why?

243
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:25,488
- I didn't have an ATM card.

244
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:26,610
I'm old.

245
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,533
No, no and I'm a businessman.

246
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,438
You never know when you're going
to walk into a situation where

247
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,297
I needed to buy 
something for $500.

248
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:35,353
I wasn't a normal kid, right?

249
00:10:35,353 --> 00:10:38,208
I was doing business so I might
go to Toys "R" Us and they might

250
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,732
have all the Power Rangers 
and I'm gonna need cash.

251
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:43,865
- Now, now?
- Uh-huh.

252
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:45,244
It's a real pleasure, 
we'll talk later.

253
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,138
- [Man 3] We'll 
have dinner together.

254
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:47,954
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to.

255
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:51,225
I'm big on sales, 
in general, I'm,

256
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:53,977
for me personally, and this is
not a tried and true answer.

257
00:10:53,977 --> 00:10:54,776
For me.

258
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:57,533
I love people that 
sold stuff in their life.

259
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,217
There's something consistent
about it that's really worked

260
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:02,911
out for me in the last 20 years.

261
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:07,625
And they can be tech-nerdy, you
know the kids I like coming up

262
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,208
the game would rip music from
Napster and put it on CDs and

263
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,184
sell it in school.

264
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:14,973
So it was a little tech,
it was a little product, right?

265
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,046
I was baseball 
cards and lemonade.

266
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:18,722
Some people 
were candy, you know?

267
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:20,893
So I like sales.

268
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:24,733
I try to figure out as hard core

269
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:27,383
as I can do they need to do this

270
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:31,891
because they can't breathe if
they did anything else or are

271
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,139
they doing it because they think
there's more money in it or

272
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,149
because it's cool now.

273
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,666
I think that 95% of the startup
founders that I meet are doing

274
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,738
it the other two things.

275
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:44,723
They're either doing because
they think the money is there

276
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:48,461
'cause they get seduced by the
exits they read about or because

277
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:51,959
it's now cool to 
be a startup founder.

278
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,947
So I hate the 
current state of startup.

279
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:55,826
Hate it.

280
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:58,726
I've not been investing at
all for last year and a half.

281
00:11:58,726 --> 00:11:59,674
Nothing.

282
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:01,378
I made a couple big 
investments in things

283
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:02,476
that are really involved in.

284
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:04,387
But the kind of stuff 
you guys are mainly doing,

285
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:06,703
I'm not even taking meetings.

286
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:07,878
Because I feel like we

287
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:10,039
have the greatest era of 
fake entrepreneurship ever.

288
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,238
In the U.S. it 
just became so big and

289
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:13,466
powerful and popular everybody

290
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,434
did it and in other places
it was good for the country,

291
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:19,643
the region, it was 
the right thing to do

292
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:21,699
which were both true.

293
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,725
The problem is it brings a lot
of people into the game that

294
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:25,180
aren't meant to be.

295
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,902
So my biggest thing 
that I'm looking for the best

296
00:12:26,902 --> 00:12:30,777
entrepreneur and founder is are 
they an entrepreneur and founder

297
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:32,905
or are they acting like one?

298
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:35,049
And that's too hard.

299
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:37,552
And unlike the advice that 
I gave downstairs about well,

300
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:38,885
hire and fire.

301
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,912
You can't unfire 
$100,000 investment.

302
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:42,869
You know?

303
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:47,469
And so, I think that I look
for people that are driven,

304
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,644
patient and not fancy.

305
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,385
The amount of people that are
founders of companies who go

306
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:54,910
skiing on the weekend.

307
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,529
Who go to every 
marketing meet up event.

308
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,214
Who take selfies 
with micro celebrities.

309
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,464
We're in such a bullshit era.

310
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:07,533
Basically club promoters have
taken over entrepreneurship.

311
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:10,551
("Marvellissss" 
by Notion Beats)

312
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,003
It's the truth.

313
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,071
And the reason there's giggles
and head nods is we know it.

314
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:17,120
Just became cool.

315
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,467
Document over create.

316
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:22,030
My point on creating content is
instead of trying to think what

317
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,044
you make, just document 
everything you're doing.

318
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:26,429
If you, do you know that two
or three of you if you just

319
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:30,095
documented the journey of
figuring this out that people

320
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:32,674
would watch your video on
YouTube every day of you trying

321
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:36,096
figure out the school system
and that in itself is what would

322
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:39,132
build your business.

323
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:42,544
It's a story, it's the 
journey of an entrepreneur.

324
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:46,735
The legacy that I'm 
creating with DailyVee, fuck.

325
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,972
You know how cool that's gonna
be when there's 10 years worth

326
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:51,179
of my every day?

327
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:53,349
Big day. Big day.

328
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,494
- [DRock] Great day.
- Great day, right?

329
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:57,913
- [DRock] Great day.
- Great day in Belgium.

330
00:13:57,913 --> 00:14:00,056
Especially if I 
pull off very big things.

331
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:02,850
I would love, you know how fun
it would be to watch the three

332
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,919
years before 
Drake became famous,

333
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,094
everything he did.

334
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,540
You know how 
fascinating that is.

335
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,964
And by the way, even if it
never changed your business,

336
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:12,132
do you know how much fun it 
would be for your granddaughter

337
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:13,847
to watch you do it.

338
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,207
Really, think about life.

339
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:16,715
You know 
inspiring that would be.

340
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:18,589
She'd be like damn, 
grandma was a hustler.

341
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,279
(group laughter)

342
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,697
I want to be 
one too. No, really.

343
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:22,366
Right.

344
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:25,100
You know how much fun it would
be for me right now to see my

345
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,273
dad making $2 an hour in 1979.

346
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:31,297
Waking up at 4:30, driving
working 15 hours in a liquor

347
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:32,617
store and then coming back.

348
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:35,578
That's cool.

349
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:38,436
I don't think we 
think long term enough.

350
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:40,878
What it really means.

351
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:42,512
You know, I look at 
stuff now and I'm like oh man,

352
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:43,381
I was so young.

353
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:44,612
Oh shit, I was pretty fat.

354
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:48,512
You know, it's cool.

355
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,519
That's why I do it.

356
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,366
- [Sam] The reality that you're
in yourselves makes it so real.

357
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:55,195
- [Gary] I think 
everything about me is

358
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,362
pulling it in opposite directions.

359
00:14:57,362 --> 00:15:01,361
I'm the most inspirational 
and the most practical.

360
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:02,404
You know, I'm in it.

361
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:05,539
(inaudible) It's my life.

362
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:06,881
- [Sam] The priest was here.

363
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,243
There's the skull.

364
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:11,686
- [Gary] It's in, 
this is so awesome.

365
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:13,905
It's unbelievably cool.

366
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:15,804
So modern, so rad, I'm excited.

367
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:17,196
I'm gonna eat 
everything in sight.

368
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,429
(group laughter)

369
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:21,199
I'm so happy 
Jordan's not here.

370
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,379
(group laughter)

371
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,438
Alright, I'm gonna 
make sure I have no fires

372
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:26,392
for three minutes, then 
I'm gonna do the call and

373
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,065
then we can really hang.

374
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:31,006
I just hate when 
I'm out of commission.

375
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:32,035
- Charge your phone, no?

376
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:33,208
- I need to charge it 
but I'll get that from DRock.

377
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,288
("Marvellissss" by
Notion Beats)

378
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:42,019
Hey Snapchat.

379
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,142
Here's where the 
meet up's happening.

380
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:47,118
This fancy restaurant, this
grassy knoll right near it.

381
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:48,334
Here I am.

382
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:49,787
Next picture.

383
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:51,742
I do a call-in show,

384
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,199
I said a lot of 
entrepreneurs like to

385
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,387
read books, come to 
conferences, have meetings,

386
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:01,840
but they don't want to do.

387
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,083
I said it reminds me of the guy

388
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,003
who wants to play tennis and

389
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:10,533
instead of practicing what he
does is he goes to the sporting

390
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:13,657
goods store and he 
buys the best sneakers,

391
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:16,282
he buys 
Roger Federer's headband,

392
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:19,040
he buys the best tennis racket.

393
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,477
Brand new shorts and 
then he goes on the court

394
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:24,516
and he loses 6-0.

395
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,780
That's what I see with 
a lot of entrepreneurs.

396
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,496
They've watched all my 
videos, read all your books,

397
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:33,759
they've done all the courses,

398
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,314
they don't want to do the work.

399
00:16:37,314 --> 00:16:39,640
When you look at the guys and
girls that are great tennis

400
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,330
players they spent everyday of
their childhood playing tennis.

401
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,197
- [Man 4] No other way.

402
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:46,628
- There's no other way.

403
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:49,229
- [Woman 3] So what you're
saying is they guys who are

404
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:51,875
looking at your videos are 
not real entrepreneurs.

405
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,969
- I'm saying that the ones.

406
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,028
- [Man 5] I never watch them.

407
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:56,494
(group laughter)

408
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:58,114
- Here's what I'll say, 
here's what I'll say.

409
00:16:58,114 --> 00:17:02,057
The ones that only watch them
and never do are not and there's

410
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:03,783
a lot of people that do that.

411
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:07,449
They get the feeling 
from me, and that's enough.

412
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:12,109
My best days are when I'm
reading my Instagram comments

413
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,908
and people are like,

414
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:14,973
"This is my last video, 
I'm ready to go."

415
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:16,408
And I love it.

416
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:19,991
Not good for me following
count, not good for my views,

417
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:23,021
the best for my heart.

418
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:24,293
'Cause there's 
always somebody else.

419
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,963
Which is why I spend a lot of
time trying to get people to

420
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,454
build practical businesses
because there's a lot of people

421
00:24:19,296 --> 00:17:33,906
- [Man 18] I would like 
to try to take a gap year.

422
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:36,369
There's not a lot that can
build a billion dollar company.

423
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:37,217
- [Man 6] Yeah.

424
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:40,000
- And so, I'm trying to push the
practicality of entrepreneurship

425
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,583
and startup and it's working.

426
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,637
You saw that 
kid today who said,

427
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:45,183
"Hey, you helped me.

428
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:46,348
"I was gonna try 
to build Facebook,

429
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:47,819
"now I've got 
this good business."

430
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:49,015
It's exciting.

431
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:52,448
There's no feeling, 
you know it's funny,

432
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,742
I can go close a 
$4 million deal with

433
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:57,048
Kellogg's or IBM, fine.

434
00:17:57,048 --> 00:18:01,137
I come home and I get an email
from a kid who tells me there's

435
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:02,241
no better feeling than that.

436
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:03,521
That's legacy.

437
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:04,943
I always knew how to make money.

438
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:06,246
That's nothing new.

439
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:08,517
The legacy of 
impacting people that's new.

440
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:09,621
That's exciting.

441
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,946
That's hearing, 
that kid would've failed.

442
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:14,847
Now maybe he won't.

443
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:17,523
Not only will he then feel the
benefits but his children will.

444
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:19,255
That's impact.

445
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:22,320
- I started 
working out. (laughs)

446
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,249
- It's good, man.

447
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,450
(crowd cheering)

448
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,587
- [Crowd] Gary, Gary, Gary!

449
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,315
- How's everybody?

450
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,069
Good?
(crowd cheers)

451
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:39,896
Alright, let's do it.

452
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:40,889
- [Man 7] How's the food?

453
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:43,140
- Food was 
fucking ridiculously good.

454
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,985
(group laughter)

455
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:47,358
Alright, here's my concept for
this so I can get through this.

456
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:50,879
Let's first do selfies and
signed books and then we can do

457
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,365
questions because otherwise
people would have to wait four

458
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,394
or five hours.

459
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:55,318
I've done this before.

460
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:57,533
So let's first do the photos and
things of that nature then

461
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,004
I'll try to answer 
questions if I can.

462
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:00,997
Where is DRock?

463
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:03,562
- DRock's over there.
- [Gary] Oh, hi DRock.

464
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:04,778
Awesome, real pleasure.

465
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,803
- [Man 8] Who's the 
best NBA player ever?

466
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:08,319
- [Gary] Who's the 
best NBA player ever?

467
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,292
- [Man 8] Yeah.
- Patrick Ewing.

468
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:14,346
You're not recording. 
(crowd laughter)

469
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:15,256
How long'd that take you?

470
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:17,036
- [Man 9] An hour.
Two hours.

471
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:20,520
- [Man 10] I took 3 hours.
- Yeah.

472
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,610
- Thanks man.
- You're welcome, man.

473
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,828
Thanks for coming.

474
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,443
Reverse engineer yourself.

475
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:25,664
Don't try to be somebody else.

476
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,184
Not for your parents, 
not for me,

477
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:28,931
not for him, for yourself.

478
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:32,659
- Thank you, Gary.
- [Gary] You got it.

479
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:35,496
Fuck man.
(group laughter)

480
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:38,543
Lots of pens, lots of pens.

481
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:41,728
- [Man 11] You're the one that
made me shift towards gratitude

482
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:42,488
in my business.

483
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:43,503
And--

484
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:45,142
- [Gary] Funny thing happens 
when you make that move.

485
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,288
- [Man 11] True, right.
- Yeah.

486
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:49,856
You know, all these 
things are switches.

487
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,250
Everybody wants 
these little things.

488
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,393
They're binary.

489
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:54,369
You're either on or you're off.
- [Man 11] Yep.

490
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,713
- There's no half-pregnant.

491
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:58,166
- [Man 11] The process.
- The process. Love it.

492
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,593
- [Man 12] I really want to work
for you but my question is the

493
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:03,391
only thing that I'm missing 
is a good financial base.

494
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:04,033
- Yep.

495
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,699
- [Man 12] I know how to get it
but how can I work in that way

496
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:10,707
where I still have 
something to say in my own idea

497
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:12,218
the best possible way?

498
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:14,463
- [Gary] Well, if you don't have
the money and if you raise the

499
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,072
money you don't have the say,
then you have to wait until you

500
00:20:17,072 --> 00:20:18,480
have the money to have the say.

501
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,988
- [Man 12] That's the 
best and only way, you think?

502
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:21,925
- It's the only way 
if you want to have say.

503
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:25,124
Unless you decide this
idea's worth you learning from.

504
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,530
The biggest problem everybody
here is gonna make is they think

505
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,296
their current idea 
is the end all, be all.

506
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,754
A lot of your businesses and
ideas are stepping stones.

507
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:33,373
- [Man 12] Okay.

508
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:35,697
- [Gary] So maybe it's
better for you to not have say,

509
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:37,247
learn what's good, 
learn what's bad.

510
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,211
You're a young man.

511
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:40,409
You know what's great 
about being a businessman?

512
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:43,309
Is you don't retire 
at 31 like an athlete.

513
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,529
You play forever.

514
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:47,586
So instead of waiting until you
make the money to have control

515
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,277
maybe it's better 
to not have control,

516
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:50,823
you learn, it sucks 'cause

517
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:52,531
you don't have 
control but you learn.

518
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:55,445
Maybe you'll make some money and
then you can take the money and

519
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:56,532
go do your next thing.

520
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:57,907
You're always gonna have ideas.

521
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:59,036
This isn't your first idea.

522
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:00,510
- [Man 12] That's 
true, that's true.

523
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,013
- Got it? Don't fall in 
love with an idea.

524
00:21:02,013 --> 00:21:03,011
- [Man 12] Okay, exactly.

525
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:03,876
Thank you, man.
- You're welcome.

526
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:04,770
- [Man 13] Gary?
- [Gary] Yes.

527
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,813
- [Man 13] Can I 
ask you a question?

528
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:07,224
- [Gary] Yes but we 
need to do, we're getting,

529
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,251
this is what always happens.

530
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:10,625
Let me bang out a little bit
more but I will answer it,

531
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,705
I promise you.
- [Man 13] Yes.

532
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:12,922
- [Gary] This is what you make?

533
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:15,776
- [Man 14] That's her product,
and she's doing the hustle.

534
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,116
- [Gary] Love it.

535
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:20,512
Just a happy family.

536
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,811
Cousin Gary in town.

537
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:24,427
- [Man 15] With the 
man here, Gary Vaynerchuk.

538
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:26,317
- [Gary] We're together. 
With all our friends.

539
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:28,294
Execution's the game.
- [Man 15] Yeah, man.

540
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:32,541
- [Gary] Ideas are 
shit without execution.

541
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,037
Real pleasure.
- [Man 15] Of course.

542
00:21:34,037 --> 00:21:35,201
- [Gary] Good, man.
How are you?

543
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:38,802
- [Man 16] I want to say to
you that if today I stand here,

544
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:43,113
it's because of one guy who is
behind you who listened to what

545
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:45,248
you had said that you 
have to cut friends from

546
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:46,089
your inner circle.
- [Gary] Yes.

547
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:47,328
- To succeed.
- Yes.

548
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:51,660
- And today I'm able to achieve
greatness because I will show

549
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,695
him you do not 
have friends to make it.

550
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:55,698
- I love it, man.
Well good.

551
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:56,920
- And may I have a picture?

552
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,973
- Yes, sir. Respect.

553
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:03,227
- Thanks for 
replying to me on Twitter.

554
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:04,623
- [Gary] My pleasure.

555
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,039
Find a way.

556
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:06,840
Thank you, man.

557
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,496
Too many people try 
to make a narrative.

558
00:22:08,496 --> 00:22:11,498
The only narrative that 
works is your true narrative.

559
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,737
So many people here fronting as
experts or as coaches and making

560
00:22:14,737 --> 00:22:16,546
stuff happen, you're aspiring.

561
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:17,425
You're through the process.

562
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:20,118
Document your, your best story
that will get more people to buy

563
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:23,603
more jewelry than anything is
that you guys come out and say

564
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:24,387
we're just starting.

565
00:22:24,387 --> 00:22:25,332
We don't know shit.

566
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:27,345
We just know that we want to
put this out in the world.

567
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,762
People will relate to that
more than you saying we're this,

568
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:31,345
we're that. Got it?
- [Woman 4] Yeah.

569
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:32,953
- The truth always wins.
- [Woman 4] Okay.

570
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:34,908
- It might not be 
winning this moment,

571
00:22:34,908 --> 00:22:39,148
this month, this year but 
it always wins in the end.

572
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:40,180
You understand?
- [Woman 4] Yeah.

573
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,977
- Look, people's mouths are
way ahead and ambitions are way

574
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:46,244
ahead of their actions.

575
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:49,498
Everybody's talking shit but
people aren't putting the work.

576
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:51,312
So you just need, 
by the way, by the way,--

577
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:52,679
- If that's your goal.
- Exactly.

578
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,594
Do you know how great it is
to make $100,000 a year and be

579
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:58,620
happy and go on vacation and
love your life, it's great.

580
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,664
Everybody now thinks 
they have to build Facebook.

581
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,302
It's so stupid.
- Exactly.

582
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:03,298
- You just need 
to know yourself.

583
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,606
- And can you start at 28?
- You can start at 58.

584
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:08,609
- And building 
million dollar businesses?

585
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:09,777
- Of course. 
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

586
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:11,639
the guy was 75 
years old when he started.

587
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:12,947
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

588
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:14,743
- Thank you.
- Yeah, hug, man.

589
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,343
(group cheering)

590
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:18,418
- [Man 17] The greatest person

591
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:20,418
I've ever met on 
this fucking planet.

592
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:21,189
- [Gary] Thank you, man.

593
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,292
- [Man 17] For real, 
like look what you've done.

594
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,842
- [Gary] Thank you, man.
- It's fucking amazing.

595
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:25,361
I look forward to 
actually like grow up.

596
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:27,498
To follow you 
the next five, ten,

597
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:29,177
twenty years 
it's fucking insane.

598
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:30,187
- [Gary] Thank you, man. 
Thank you, brother.

599
00:23:30,187 --> 00:23:30,878
- Thank you so much.
- [Gary] Thank you so much.

600
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:32,861
If I grew up in the era that
you're growing up in this shit

601
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:34,395
would've been 
over a long time ago.

602
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:35,543
(group laughter)

603
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:37,657
If I had eBay and 
Shopify and Google and

604
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:39,732
fucking the internet, 
I didn't have shit.

605
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:41,233
There was no computers.

606
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:44,238
Fucking went to 
the store, bought shit,

607
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:47,144
went to the flea market 
on Saturday and sold it.

608
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:50,076
Like you guys have 
it so good, so easy.

609
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:53,277
You have it so good, so easy

610
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:56,097
that it tricks 
you that it's easy.

611
00:23:56,097 --> 00:23:58,229
It's so good and so 
easy that you're getting

612
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,219
tricked that it's easy.

613
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:01,061
It's not easy.

614
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:03,110
Yo, you ready for this?
- Yeah.

615
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,414
- Hustle you mother fucker. 
(group laughter)

616
00:24:06,414 --> 00:24:08,206
- [Man 18] Business on the 
side or take a gap year and

617
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:09,113
try to launch it?

618
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:10,697
- Both work.
- [Man 18] Both?

619
00:24:10,697 --> 00:24:11,378
- Both work.

620
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:12,232
- [Man 18] Which one is best?

621
00:24:12,232 --> 00:24:13,346
- I don't know you well enough.

622
00:24:13,346 --> 00:24:16,226
You know. 
You know what I mean?

623
00:24:16,226 --> 00:24:19,296
They both work.
Which one do you want to do?

624
00:31:30,267 --> 00:24:20,679
("Still Waiting" by Jura Kez)

625
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:21,521
- So take a gap year.

626
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:23,501
- [Man 18] I'm scared.
- That's why you're asking.

627
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:25,150
- [Man 18] Yes.

628
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,554
Which one would you do?

629
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:27,505
- I wouldn't take either.

630
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:29,660
- [Man 18] What 
would you do then?

631
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,622
- I can't answer that for you.
Fear is holding you back.

632
00:24:32,622 --> 00:24:34,245
You know what you want to do.

633
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,218
The only reason you're not doing
is 'cause you're scared of doing

634
00:24:36,218 --> 00:24:38,830
what you actually 
want to do. Right?

635
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,627
- [Man 18] Yes.

636
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:42,356
- Are you scared to do it 'cause
your parents won't like it?

637
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,435
- [Man 18] No, my 
parents actually supports me.

638
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:46,661
- Okay, so what are 
you scared of? Failing?

639
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:51,123
- [Man 18] Not failing but still
being at the same place when my

640
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:54,978
friends are at the next level.
- Huge mistake.

641
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:56,607
You don't want the same 
things your friends want.

642
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:57,439
- [Man 18] No.

643
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:59,214
- So why the fuck do 
you care what they have?

644
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,277
Number one mistake so many
people make is they care about

645
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:02,524
what other people have.

646
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:04,332
I don't give a 
fuck what anybody has.

647
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:06,613
If I have more, if I 
have less, doesn't matter.

648
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,102
I worry about myself.

649
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:09,869
The fact that you're 
worrying about other people's

650
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:11,888
accomplishments is 
already a losing formula.

651
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:13,257
You need to get 
rid of that first then

652
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:14,328
you can focus on yourself.
- [Man 18] Thank you.

653
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:16,356
You understand?
- [Man 18] Yes, I do.

654
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:18,044
- You just have to talk these
things through and when you get

655
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:20,432
to the right answer, you 
answered it which I love.

656
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:21,195
- [Man 18] Yes.

657
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:24,129
- So the fact that you care that
one year later you do your thing

658
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:26,552
which you loved and you decided
you wanted to do but you weren't

659
00:25:26,552 --> 00:25:29,435
successful and your friend got
a job and now he's got a little

660
00:25:29,435 --> 00:25:31,106
bit more money 
that that bothers you.

661
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:34,510
I built up a $45 million
business in four years and was

662
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,321
still paying myself $40,000.

663
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:41,290
No fancy car, no fuckin' watch,
no fucking bling bling because

664
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,690
I knew what I was doing it for.

665
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,749
I believed fully,
she's still here,

666
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:46,275
in what I was doing.

667
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:50,542
Right, you're worried about way
too many short-term goals when

668
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:52,855
your mouth says that 
you want big time goals.

669
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,653
- [Man 18] Yes. Thank you.
- [Gary] You're welcome.

670
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,457
- [Man 19] Gary?
- Yeah?

671
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:57,835
- [Man 19] Do you recommend
that you document your journey?

672
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:00,163
- Yes. Guys, the 
amount of people that

673
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:01,169
are asking me questions,

674
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:03,230
dude, I'm just 
gonna say it real quick.

675
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,423
Everybody's asking me questions
that they know the answers to.

676
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:10,533
The fact that you used the words
"document the journey"

677
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,459
(group laughter)

678
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:14,449
you know I believe in that.
- [Man 19] Uh-huh.

679
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,364
- Same with you.

680
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:16,463
Everybody, 
same with a bunch,

681
00:26:16,463 --> 00:26:17,995
you're all 
looking for permission.

682
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,285
- [Man 19] I'm 
afraid of documenting.

683
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:20,381
- That's it.

684
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:22,524
That's right, 
everybody, it's all fear 'cause

685
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:23,733
it's a binary thing.

686
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:26,563
Once you get your mindset around
why you're doing things and that

687
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:29,590
you're doing it for 
yourself it all opens up.

688
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,158
Both of you, back to back, 
care about other people.

689
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,384
- [Man 19] Mhmmm.
- And that's fine.

690
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:38,906
I care, I don't want to let
my parents down but not at the

691
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:43,959
expense of my one life.

692
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:44,924
- [Man 19] Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, man.

693
00:26:44,924 --> 00:26:46,195
Yeah. Cool.

694
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:48,853
Again, watch what I do. 
Just don't listen, do shit.

695
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:49,739
- [Man 20] Right.

696
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:51,399
- Like when I thought 
of the 60 Second Club,

697
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,367
I did it an hour later.

698
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:54,344
And I have a big audience.

699
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:56,584
I have a lot to lose.
- [Man 20] Mhmmm.

700
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:59,632
- Right? I have a lot to lose.

701
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:01,446
And then again, I just said it.

702
00:27:01,446 --> 00:27:04,990
It's been fucking three 
months, I switched back.

703
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,534
I'm not scared to change.

704
00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:09,018
- [Man 20] Just do shit.
- Do shit.

705
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:12,297
I knew that I was a 
businessman and when you guys,

706
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,984
most of you didn't 
see this the big man that

707
00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:15,096
I hugged out he saw it.

708
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:18,118
I was the wine guy.
- [Man 21] Yeah.

709
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:19,538
- I was the wine guy.

710
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,886
So I started making business
videos and everybody's comments

711
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:24,582
were, "Stick to wine." 
"Do what you do."

712
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:26,538
"What the fuck do 
you know about business?"

713
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:27,603
I had already built a business.

714
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:29,673
People didn't 
even know me for that.

715
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:32,752
Just do shit.
- [Man 20] Mhmmm.

716
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,400
- I decided I'm gonna 
start a beanie company,

717
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,852
I may or may not but 
I'm trying to do it. Right?

718
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:38,930
- [Man 22] More, more, more.

719
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,845
- Remember the honey company?

720
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:40,959
Where's the honey company?

721
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,619
'Member for some of 
you that watch #AskGaryVee?

722
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:44,988
There is no honey company.

723
00:27:44,988 --> 00:27:46,982
VaynerToys failed, 
there's no honey company.

724
00:27:46,982 --> 00:27:48,671
I didn't get to it. 
But I tried to.

725
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:51,482
I got a lot of samples, 
I got a lot of data.

726
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:52,764
I'm just doing all the time.

727
00:27:52,764 --> 00:27:55,229
We're ideating everyday, 
making up shit on the spot.

728
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:56,152
- [Man 20] Playing around. 
Testing.

729
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:57,623
- Playing, doing, 
doing, doing, doing.

730
00:27:57,623 --> 00:28:00,328
If one out of 
30 things succeeds,

731
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:01,914
it's better than 
all of the things that

732
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:05,564
you guys haven't started.

733
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:10,337
- [Man 20] Boom.
- Yeah. You got it?

734
00:28:10,337 --> 00:28:11,425
Go, go do something.

735
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:14,213
(group laughter)

736
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:15,896
Dude, what the 
fuck is this thing?

737
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:18,616
(group laughter)

738
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:20,619
I love the old school, my man.

739
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:22,388
Alright guys, thank 
you so much for coming.

740
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:24,138
A vlog?
- Yeah.

741
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:27,657
One, the biggest value that
you can share with my viewers.

742
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:29,900
- Well what kind of 
viewers are they? Youngsters?

743
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,790
- Youngsters like me.

744
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,976
People wanting 
to start a business.

745
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,569
People who need 
personal development.

746
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:34,446
- It's patience.

747
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,635
It's fucking patience. 
It's patience.

748
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:38,549
Like all of you 
want it too fast.

749
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,945
I'm 41 years old and 
I feel like I'm seven.

750
00:28:41,945 --> 00:28:46,587
Like when I was 20, when I
was 15 or 17 or 22 I thought

751
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:49,605
41-year-olds were
so fuckin' old.

752
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:50,771
They felt so old.

753
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:54,328
I wish all of you 13, 16, 19
and 24-year-olds could feel how

754
00:28:54,328 --> 00:28:55,899
young I am in my soul right now.

755
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,543
It would change 
everything you do.

756
00:28:57,543 --> 00:29:00,184
You'd become dramatically more
patient which would mean that

757
00:29:00,184 --> 00:29:01,928
you would make a lot 
more of the successes

758
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:03,215
that you want to happen.

759
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:07,145
Most of you will lose because
you're trying to take shortcuts.

760
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,582
- Wow. The process.
- The process.

761
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:10,414
- [Man 23] I have a question.

762
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,633
- My pleasure.
And you're young.

763
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:15,893
You can make 19 mistakes 
and start at 30 and

764
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:16,696
get your shit going.

765
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:18,990
- [Man 23] Thank you.
- [Gary] Lack of patience.

766
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,053
- [Man 23] Okay.
- Lack of patience.

767
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:23,033
That's what that ladders up to.

768
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,712
I'm here, I'm here.

769
00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:26,398
You got it, DRock?

770
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,416
(crowd cheers)

771
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:34,150
Bye guys, I love you. See ya.

772
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,509
- I have an idea 
for an application but

773
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:38,845
it's like for charity.
- Okay.

774
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:42,052
- Normally people don't 
give gifts to donations.

775
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:44,177
- Yep. Gamification works.
- Mhmmm.

776
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:46,321
- [Gary] Charity 
donations happen.

777
00:29:46,321 --> 00:29:48,786
The combination of the two and
the economics around building an

778
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,766
actual business, the problem is
right now everybody's building

779
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:54,239
apps and they're 
not building businesses.

780
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:56,642
- Mhmmm. Yeah, it's true.
- [Gary] I know.

781
00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:58,261
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

782
00:29:58,261 --> 00:29:59,821
- [Gary] That is what 
you need to think about.

783
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:00,629
- Thank you.

784
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:03,604
- [Gary] It's the 
business of apps not apps

785
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:04,690
that are businesses.

786
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,148
Everybody's thinking about apps.

787
00:30:06,148 --> 00:30:07,348
Your app might be right.

788
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,295
Do you have a 
sustainable business?

789
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:10,487
The economics of 
the scale of what

790
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:11,948
you're building 
is very difficult.

791
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:13,532
- That's true.
- [Gary] Got it?

792
00:30:13,532 --> 00:30:14,766
Cool.
- Thank you for your time.

793
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:15,554
- [Gary] Awesome.

794
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:16,470
- [Man 24] Thank you. 
You were it for me.

795
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,675
- [Gary] I hope so. 
What's up, brother?

796
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:19,353
- [Man 25] One thing 
you would have done

797
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:20,327
differently in VaynerMedia?

798
00:30:20,327 --> 00:30:21,929
(Gary clicks tongue)

799
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:22,826
Zero.

800
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:23,589
(group laughter) 
No regrets.

801
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:26,703
- [Gary] No regrets. None.

802
00:30:26,703 --> 00:30:27,900
Let me give you 
the best piece of,

803
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,159
I appreciate you asking that.

804
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,356
What value in the world does
it have to look backwards in a

805
00:30:34,356 --> 00:30:36,200
world where you're gonna 
make a ton more mistakes.

806
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,913
Do you know what I mean?

807
00:30:37,913 --> 00:30:40,802
Reconciling mistakes you've made
in the past in a world where

808
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:42,907
you're gonna be making 
a bunch more seems like

809
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,171
a waste of 
energy to me. You know?

810
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:48,686
That's what, you learn from your
mistakes but like who knows if

811
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:53,060
I didn't do that, 
everything's wired together.

812
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,389
If I didn't make that mistake
but would've lead me to that

813
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:57,689
meeting which 
became my ultimate upside?

814
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,083
You can't unwind them.

815
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:02,759
Everybody wants to 
unwind shit to tactics.

816
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,326
That's why I stay 
so macro, got it?

817
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:06,080
- [Man 25] We're 
gonna make a copy of it.

818
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,875
We're coming for you.
- [Gary] Awesome.

819
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,023
I hope so, man, do it.

820
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:09,370
My man.
- [Man 26] Thank you very much.

821
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,728
- [Gary] You're never 
gonna beat what you copy.

822
00:31:10,728 --> 00:31:13,290
(group laughter)

823
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:19,374
1:06 in the morning.

824
00:31:19,374 --> 00:31:21,746
Leaving four or five 
hours to the airport.

825
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,105
Hustled it hard in Belgium.

826
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:26,876
Brought it in Belgium.

827
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,656
Fuckin' brought it.

828
00:31:28,656 --> 00:17:30,454
Fucking brought it.

829
00:17:30,454 --> 00:00:00,000
that could make 
100,000 a year in profit.
