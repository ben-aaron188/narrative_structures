1
00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:03,318
- What up blog, hope
everyone's doing super well.

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:07,578
This is a keynote that I gave in Singapore

3
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:09,795
that really struck.

4
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:11,916
There's a bunch of stuff
in management and running

5
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,786
operations, a lot of my stuff
is for early entrepreneurs.

6
00:00:14,786 --> 00:00:17,762
I think for everybody
who is running a business

7
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:21,746
with several employees or
seven figures in revenue

8
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:24,292
are gonna get a lot out of this one.

9
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,992
So, I hope you enjoy it,

10
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:29,052
and I hope you like my sweater.

11
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:31,978
♪ We're unstoppable ♪

12
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:35,026
- I'm really excited to be
here, thank you so much.

13
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:38,347
So, we have a lot of time
together, which is amazing,

14
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:41,065
and so, I will take
full advantage of that,

15
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:44,595
and to be very honest, I wanna
get into the Q and A part

16
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:47,902
and start throwing this out
to you guys to ask questions,

17
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,950
so I'm gonna try to get to
that as quickly as possible,

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,495
because I think, for me, when I speak,

19
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:56,456
and what I think has
allowed me to have a nice

20
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,671
speaking career is I'm
obsessed with bringing in

21
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:01,002
as much value to the audience as possible.

22
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:04,226
My origin story of Belarus
and lemonade stands

23
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:06,654
and baseball cards is
something that you can see

24
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:09,148
on YouTube over and over and over again,

25
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:11,244
and as I continue through
my career of speaking,

26
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:13,950
I wanna do less of that,
and to be very frank,

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,569
the reason I wrote a
book called AskGaryVee

28
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:19,305
is it's my great ambition
to build enough brand

29
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:21,980
where I could come to
an environment like this

30
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,970
and just go right into Q and A,

31
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,320
because at the end of the day,

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,967
I think that's where the biggest value

33
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,009
happens in a keynote,
and so, what I'll do,

34
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,061
because I'm gonna assume
some of you and many

35
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,302
of you may not know who I am.

36
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:34,426
I'll try to at least
deliver on the promise

37
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:38,003
of giving a keynote, but
please rest assured that

38
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:42,148
I'm ready to go into Q and
A as soon as you guys are.

39
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:45,063
So, look, I think the thing that,

40
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,766
regardless if you're
a B2B or B2C marketer,

41
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:51,274
regardless if you're
starting on your first day

42
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:53,686
or you've got a $100 million company,

43
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:57,040
I think the thing that
will really be important

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,278
for us to chat about first is

45
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,428
the thing that we're all connected by,

46
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:04,150
which is my obsession with attention.

47
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,062
Right, before you can tell
me how great your product is

48
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:08,816
or how charismatic you are,

49
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:11,792
or why you're so right about what you have

50
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:15,616
to say to the world, whether
as a person or as a business,

51
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:19,117
you have to get the person's
attention to tell your story.

52
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:21,403
To me, this is the most fascinating thing

53
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:23,683
that's happening right now in our society,

54
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:26,766
is that attention has never been more

55
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:31,888
changing, has never been harder to grasp,

56
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:34,022
I think for a lot of us
that have been in business

57
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:37,554
for a long time it's very
difficult to grab the current

58
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:40,758
changing landscape of
attention at the speed

59
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:42,265
of which it changes.

60
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:45,916
I spend eight, 10, 12, 15 hours a day

61
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,788
trying to audit and understand attention,

62
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:51,872
and even for me, there's so
many things still happening

63
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,035
that I haven't been able to
completely grab my hands on,

64
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,666
whether it's the depth of eSports,

65
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,165
arbitrage as a cultural phenomenon,

66
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:01,663
whether it's the blockchain,

67
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:04,679
whether it's all the
opportunity within AI and ML,

68
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,909
whether it's the emerging
AR infrastructure

69
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,887
in the Apple updates and
Google infrastructure,

70
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:12,934
whether it's voice, which I
speak a lot about right now,

71
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:15,193
on the Alexa, Google, and Apple fronts,

72
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:18,164
we're talking about a very different world

73
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,592
than our grandparents
and parents grew up in

74
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:23,596
as businessmen and women,
and more importantly,

75
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:26,765
as marketers and executors
and most importantly,

76
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:29,848
as actual practitioners of the craft.

77
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:33,234
I think the thing that
fascinates me the most

78
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:35,809
is how many people in here, I mean, to me,

79
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:38,834
when I think about how
many of you flew to be here

80
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,167
or are here to see me speak,

81
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,304
we, including myself,
we're so much further ahead

82
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:50,255
in understanding these things
because of our interest in it,

83
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:53,206
regardless of your success
at this point in it.

84
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:55,886
If you're sitting in this conference,

85
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,807
your intuition or curiosity or execution

86
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:01,809
around the modern day attention graph

87
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,660
and the opportunities
within it is so much further

88
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,160
accelerated than the 99%,

89
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,161
and to me, that's super interesting to me,

90
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:15,012
that we have such an
incredible opportunity in front

91
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:18,120
of us to trade on this opportunity,

92
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,798
and so, my question becomes,

93
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,914
how much of what you believe
and know about this moment

94
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:29,133
is around you reading
or consuming content,

95
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,861
and how much of it is that you're

96
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:33,476
actually executing within it?

97
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:37,809
If I can do anything to
start this keynote off with,

98
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,899
if I can lead with anything,

99
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,815
if I can impact you in any shape or form

100
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,885
to have one action item,

101
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,990
it would be for you to start
doing more of the thing.

102
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,059
Let me explain.

103
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:53,675
There's a lot of people in
this room who understand

104
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:56,621
the concept of KOLs or Facebook ads,

105
00:04:56,621 --> 00:05:00,121
but yet, I don't think enough are actually

106
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:04,378
executing within those environments.

107
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:07,650
You know, it's unbelievable
how many of you have opinions

108
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,501
on these ad products and platforms,

109
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:13,240
yet aren't spending
and executing yourself.

110
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,701
I think the thing that
I spend so much time on

111
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,325
is I produce content and do social media,

112
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,786
because I wanna stay a practitioner.

113
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:24,175
I think of it as being
a mason or a carpenter

114
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:26,697
versus being an architect.

115
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:28,905
If you look at that industry,

116
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:32,598
a lot of architects grow up
getting their hands dirty,

117
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,608
and over time, they get
separated too much from the work,

118
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:37,907
where they lose a pulse on the reality

119
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:39,866
of the current infrastructure.

120
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,489
I'm fascinated by that.

121
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:44,258
That is the thing that I
try to stay grounded in.

122
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:48,779
If I can get everybody
here to make one more ad,

123
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,063
to create one more piece of content,

124
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:55,937
to A/B test six different
headlines on the same picture

125
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:59,756
in a Facebook, Instagram,
WeChat environment.

126
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,530
These are very important variables that

127
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,201
not enough of us are talking about.

128
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:07,784
And so, at the most high level,

129
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:13,398
I would hope to inspire
people to become practitioners

130
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:17,169
instead of pontificators in
the craft of the opportunity.

131
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,188
There is only one reason I
stand up here at this keynote

132
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:23,889
and have people wanna
hear what I have to say.

133
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,254
It's because no matter what
has been happening to me,

134
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:30,337
I've not lost my pulse on
the craft of what I do.

135
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:32,978
How many people here
have been following me

136
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,228
for longer than

137
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:36,431
a year?

138
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:41,225
So, one more time,
hands, I just wanna see.

139
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:43,343
Great, almost all of you.

140
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:46,093
Most of you, 60, 70% of you.

141
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,401
I'm a simple dude.

142
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,867
I basically only believe
in 10 or 12 things,

143
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:56,143
and I pump out an obnoxious
amount of content,

144
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:58,699
which means that over
the course of a year,

145
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,949
you're gonna pretty much
grasp what my pillars are.

146
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,138
I think the only thing that allows me

147
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:08,360
the luxury of keeping your
attention over the long haul

148
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,400
is my ability to stay relevant

149
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,990
to where the opportunities are.

150
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,311
The only reason after a year or two

151
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:17,851
that it's worth your
time to give to me versus

152
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:22,101
something else, it's because
I've had a good career

153
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:24,801
for 20 years of having enough intuition

154
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:29,001
on what consumers are gonna
do, but way more importantly,

155
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:32,378
I don't talk about Alexa
skills and briefings,

156
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,835
I make an Alexa skill and briefing

157
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:37,165
so that I understand it,

158
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,528
and I would tell you, there's
a huge lesson in that.

159
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,622
I think a lot of people,

160
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:44,295
especially if they get a level of success,

161
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:47,048
start getting too far away from the craft,

162
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:50,355
and you start building around
the raising the capital,

163
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:53,811
the exiting of the company,
the writing of the book,

164
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:56,744
you know, the speaking on the keynote,

165
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,910
you just get away from the work,

166
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,560
and I would argue that it's
never been more important

167
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,003
to stay on top of the work,

168
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:07,706
because every day it's changing, right?

169
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:10,881
To me, I'm running late this
morning to our first meetings,

170
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,070
and I quickly go on Instagram Live

171
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,726
because they just created a new update

172
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:17,585
where it allows you to
bring people into your

173
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:19,578
Livestream that are watching you,

174
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:23,495
and I did not feel
comfortable being here today

175
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,833
without trying and tasting
it and understanding

176
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,907
the functionality in case one of you asked

177
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,108
me a question about it.

178
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:33,017
I mean, it's an important insight.

179
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:34,267
It's an important insight,

180
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:35,871
and it is the absolute opportunity,

181
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,683
because when you think about
the way I think about it,

182
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,258
I talk about day trading attention,

183
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,950
and when you talk about
day trading attention,

184
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,065
I'm not a Wall Street guy,
I'm not a capitals guy,

185
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:50,104
but I understand the difference between

186
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:53,313
day trading and putting
something into a mutual fund

187
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:55,515
and watching it grow, right?

188
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,333
There's a very different speed,

189
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,851
there's a very different understanding,

190
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:00,585
and that's how I think about it.

191
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:03,160
My sign now says day trading attention.

192
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,679
A year ago it used to say marketing

193
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,344
in the year that we live in.

194
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:09,380
Why did I change it from
marketing in the year

195
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,844
that we live in to day trading attention,

196
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,789
it was because I realized, oh my God,

197
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:15,457
everything we're about to talk about

198
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:17,338
is happening even faster,

199
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:20,823
that even if you believe
in something for that year,

200
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:23,832
within that year, it's changing too much,

201
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:26,927
influencer marketing, and
Facebook, and YouTube,

202
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:29,356
and Twitter, and LINE, and WeChat,

203
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,120
this stuff is changing too fast

204
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,145
and we are not keeping up
with the subtle features,

205
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:36,691
because if you really understand this,

206
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:39,042
you know, you look at something
like Instagram Stories

207
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,702
or Facebook Watch or all these subtleties,

208
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:44,863
in those little sub-arbitrages, polling,

209
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:48,133
in an Instagram, in those little features,

210
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:52,086
in those little updates
are oftentimes the marginal

211
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:55,709
opportunity that is the
biggest difference between

212
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,723
growing your business and not.

213
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,605
And so, it's exhausting
and it's difficult,

214
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:05,753
but I have one very important
statement around this

215
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:07,920
for everybody, tough luck.

216
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,491
You know, no matter
how we want it, listen,

217
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:16,051
I wish that we never evolved from email.

218
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:20,443
In 1996, I had 90% open
rates on my email newsletter.

219
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:23,506
I was crushing it, life was good.

220
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,255
I had figured out email.

221
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:28,595
Then in the early 2000s, I
figured out Google AdWords.

222
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:32,235
I wish that never
changed, I figured it out.

223
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:34,490
I won on that, then YouTube came out.

224
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,648
I had one of the first long
form shows on YouTube in 2006.

225
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:40,286
I figured it out.

226
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:43,628
I liked it, I wish Twitter
didn't come along, but it did,

227
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:47,809
and then I spent 15 hours
a day tweeting all of you,

228
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:50,585
and then I grew into one
of the most followed people

229
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:54,544
on Twitter, and then Facebook evolved.

230
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:57,874
And, like, Instagram came
up, and Snapchat came.

231
00:10:57,874 --> 00:11:00,665
Like, this is a never
ending game of attention,

232
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:02,703
distribution, and arbitrage,

233
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,903
and so I think the biggest
thing you need to understand is

234
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:10,070
the best product will always
win if people know about it.

235
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:14,936
Right, and so, I think
the thing that I spend

236
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:19,013
a lot of time on is I'm a
marketer, I like to market,

237
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:21,462
I understand marketing,
I'm a business builder,

238
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:23,754
I've built businesses.

239
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:25,718
I think there's an
incredible, interesting,

240
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,339
kind of graph between the
quality of your product

241
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,119
and how many people know about it.

242
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,903
So, for example, if
you're a great marketer,

243
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:35,145
and you listen to everything that I say,

244
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,069
and you get a lot of attention,

245
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:39,501
and your business isn't working,

246
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:43,936
a lot of times it happens to
do with your products sucking.

247
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,301
We don't spend enough time
talking about the product

248
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:49,087
or service you're selling, you know?

249
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,238
So, please, if you're
sitting in the audience

250
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:53,265
and you're looking for the magic pill,

251
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:55,306
or if you think that you're gonna be able

252
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,701
to siphon some information
that's gonna allow you

253
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,762
to play in the edges of the
arbitrage of opportunity,

254
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,770
please make sure you're
looking at your product

255
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,102
and service to make sure it delivers,

256
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:07,371
because if you follow my blueprint,

257
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:10,541
if you get results from
my ideas that you then

258
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:14,741
become an executor of,
if your product sucks,

259
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:17,277
all that I'm gonna do is
expose your product faster

260
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:20,481
and you're gonna go
out of business faster.

261
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:23,731
So, please start there, but after that,

262
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:27,491
please understand the following.

263
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:31,752
This is a golden era of
marketing for one simple reason.

264
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:35,481
The places where our
attention and our consumers'

265
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:39,605
attention are, are now
driven by marketplace bidding

266
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:43,772
dynamics, not by writing an
upfront check to get the ads.

267
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,494
Please understand this.

268
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:48,631
Please understand that
the biggest difference

269
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:52,358
for us as communicators
is we don't need millions

270
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:54,945
of dollars to do television and print

271
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:58,902
and outdoor and direct mail to hit mass,

272
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:03,017
we are trading on
marketplaces, Google, Facebook,

273
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:06,517
Snapchat, these are biddable marketplaces.

274
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:10,546
The reason this is the best time

275
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:13,721
is because those
marketplaces are underpriced.

276
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,213
Those marketplaces are
underpriced right now

277
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,221
because the biggest companies in the world

278
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:21,920
are not spending enough money on them.

279
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,480
You have to understand, when
there's a come to Jesus moment,

280
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,189
and the biggest brands in
the world properly spend

281
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:32,086
in everything that I talk about,

282
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:36,057
everything I talk about
becomes null and void.

283
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:40,127
When you have to spend
$48 CPMs to get in front

284
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:44,294
of potentially 1,000 people
in a feed instead of $7,

285
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:48,174
the mathematics don't work out as nice

286
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:50,091
for why I'm so excited.

287
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:55,102
When influencers and KOLs
start charging the proper price

288
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,364
for their product
placement and endorsement,

289
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:02,119
it won't be as fun of an opportunity.

290
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:06,718
And so, I continue to yell
at the top of my lungs

291
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,661
right now, how many people
here actually have been

292
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:11,513
following me for eight years?

293
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:13,586
Raise your hands, there's
not gonna be a lot,

294
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,829
but I'm just curious, go a
little higher, eight years?

295
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:19,011
First of all, thank you
for the eight of you.

296
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:21,508
Second of all, second of all,

297
00:14:21,508 --> 00:14:24,211
you eight have a unique understanding

298
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:27,022
of me that many others
won't, and let me explain,

299
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:29,605
for you eight, that, I can
see two of you right now,

300
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:31,015
that you understand.

301
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:34,432
I was very loud, Gary Vee, in 2009, 2010,

302
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:38,984
but then I got very quiet for my standards

303
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:43,819
in 2011, '12, '13, and then I
started getting louder again

304
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,652
in '14, '15, '15, '16, '17, right?

305
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,940
For everybody else, there's a reason.

306
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,771
I am my most excited when I think

307
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:56,854
there's an arbitrage at scale.

308
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,558
If I had been making content in 1996,

309
00:15:00,558 --> 00:15:02,841
I would've been talking and making videos

310
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,239
and audio and written word about email

311
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,320
until I put you into nausea.

312
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,928
Then I would've gotten quiet in '99,

313
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:14,418
'cause email had caught up,
and then somewhere around 2001,

314
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:17,200
I would have probably spent
24 months yelling at you

315
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,193
that this Google AdWords
thing is incredible,

316
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:21,926
intent marketing's incredible,

317
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:24,257
if somebody's searching to drink wine,

318
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,396
that's probably good to
buy for five cents a click,

319
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:29,571
and I would have yelled and screamed

320
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:31,853
for two to three years on Google AdWords,

321
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:34,856
and then somewhere around
2006, '07, it corrected.

322
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:37,640
Ah, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dah.

323
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,123
Every single person in this conference

324
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:43,258
is going to regret not spending more money

325
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:45,425
on Facebook and Instagram.

326
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:51,136
Every single person in this,
I'm talking, and by the way,

327
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:54,593
I know some of you have
a B2B SaaS business

328
00:15:54,593 --> 00:15:56,444
that you haven't been able to figure out

329
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,695
how to do Facebook ads,

330
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:01,786
but I know tons of B2B SaaS
businesses that are selling

331
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:05,516
top of the funnel and
conversion based sales every day

332
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:09,366
on Facebook at scale because
they're trying harder than you

333
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:14,019
to figure out the creative that
is the variable of success.

334
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:16,608
Please understand that the creative is the

335
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,025
absolute variable of success.

336
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:23,941
That it may be the word or
the picture or the video

337
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,108
that hasn't let you be successful
in Facebook, not Facebook.

338
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:33,622
And so, I sit here with,
as you guys can tell,

339
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:36,986
a different demeanor than
sometimes when I speak,

340
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:39,280
because I think it's very serious.

341
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,790
I think this is an enormous opportunity,

342
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,659
and I very honestly am excited that I know

343
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:47,005
three of you are gonna
email me in four years

344
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,888
and it's gonna be like,
Gary, you were right,

345
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:52,663
I didn't spend enough on
Facebook, God damn it.

346
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:55,203
So, now that we've established that,

347
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:57,953
I wanna talk about the thing that

348
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:02,691
excites me the most right
now, which is voice.

349
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:06,271
A lot of you have heard me
yell and scream about voice.

350
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,124
How many people here
have seen my enthusiasm

351
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:11,008
for voice, raise your hands, great.

352
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,233
I'm awfully passionate about it,

353
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,005
and I'm passionate about it because

354
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:19,702
of one of the more interesting
chapters in my career,

355
00:17:19,702 --> 00:17:23,488
which is when I passed on Uber, twice.

356
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:26,080
At a four million dollar evaluation.

357
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,696
In the angel round for one of
my best friends in the space.

358
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:32,219
The reason I passed was, first,

359
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,588
'cause it was a side project
for Garrett and Travis,

360
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,115
but second, 'cause I didn't see it.

361
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:42,944
But why did I invest a year
later, before it exploded?

362
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:44,558
It was because I understood that Uber

363
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,641
was selling time, not transportation.

364
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:52,904
And more importantly,
the perception of time,

365
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:55,558
because if you've ever been
to New York City like me,

366
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,559
there's nothing more humbling than waiting

367
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,789
for your Uber and watching 500 cabs

368
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,122
that are empty drive by you.

369
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:03,792
Now.

370
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:06,296
Audio.

371
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:09,402
How many people here, in the last year,

372
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:11,511
have started spending more time listening

373
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:15,355
to my podcast and watching
less video because of it,

374
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:17,192
raise your hands.

375
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:20,431
Raise it high, I want
everybody to look around.

376
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,935
This is the insight that
matters to me the most.

377
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:25,231
Right?

378
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:27,737
The reason they've done that is because

379
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:31,904
what audio allows that video
doesn't is passive consumption.

380
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:36,423
You can listen to the podcast
while doing something else.

381
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,865
You can listen to the podcast in a shower,

382
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:41,260
while you're driving,
while you're working out,

383
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,377
it's time arbitrage.

384
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:47,013
Audio will be a huge
explosion for all of us,

385
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:48,842
in every one of our businesses,

386
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:51,059
because when you're communicating,

387
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,548
and hopefully you're bringing value

388
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,823
and not running a radio commercial,

389
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:57,158
when you're communicating
and bringing value

390
00:18:57,158 --> 00:19:00,367
to your audience and building
awareness for yourself,

391
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:04,244
you're gonna be doing it in a
way that respects their time.

392
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,250
The reason I hate modern day advertising

393
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,728
is 'cause it steals time.

394
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:12,540
A pop up banner on your
phone steals your time.

395
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,710
You have to hit the X,
it's too small, it pops up,

396
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,003
it opens up, you're pissed
off, you try to exit,

397
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:21,567
and now you've wasted four seconds, which,

398
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:25,206
oh, by the way, means a lot to you.

399
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,480
It would be stunning to you
for you to realize how much

400
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,366
slower your internet that
you're used to in your office

401
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:34,865
or home has to be for you to feel it.

402
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:37,454
It's staggeringly a little.

403
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:40,704
And so, time only with health and money

404
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:46,216
and religion are now on the pedestal

405
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:49,086
of things that we care about the most,

406
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:53,253
and every technology that I
see that sells you back time

407
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,295
in exchange for your attention

408
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:59,871
will be the things that I bet on the most.

409
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,027
And that is why I am obnoxiously

410
00:20:02,027 --> 00:20:05,057
bullish on voice, and when I say voice,

411
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:10,010
I mean I think everybody
here should start a podcast.

412
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,007
I just do, and in the Q and A,

413
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:15,083
I'll show you an example of
any one of your businesses,

414
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,172
how it could be a podcast,
if you'd like to ask me,

415
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:20,558
and two, I think everybody
here should start thinking

416
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,551
about what it looks like to
develop a briefing or a skill

417
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:27,718
inside of Amazon, Facebook, excuse me,

418
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,765
Amazon, Google, Apple, whatever
Facebook comes out with,

419
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:34,539
whatever the tech giants
from China come out with,

420
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,706
it is going to be the way you search.

421
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:42,332
In the next five years,
five years from today,

422
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:45,242
I promise you, you will
be blown away by how much

423
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:49,242
of your search behavior
is done with your voice.

424
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,994
As a matter of fact, one of
the most interesting stats

425
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:55,262
that I'm paying attention to is that one

426
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:58,632
in every four searches on
Google on a mobile device

427
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,465
is done through voice.

428
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,111
And if you have young children that play

429
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:06,656
in a YouTube environment on an iPad,

430
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:09,248
my son, when he was at three,

431
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:12,915
could navigate the
entire web through voice.

432
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:15,187
So,

433
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:16,239
look.

434
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:18,656
My point here is very simple.

435
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,918
We are ridiculously lucky,

436
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:30,902
because we get to navigate
through this time.

437
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:34,345
For anybody over 30, and
especially if you're over 40,

438
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:35,771
you really recognize that,

439
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,669
because, for the over 40 crowd in here,

440
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:40,919
we lived pre-internet in a lot of ways.

441
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:45,217
The scale is remarkable,
the impact is high,

442
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:49,294
the upside's enormous,
and to be very honest,

443
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:52,579
I think most of us are
just taking it for granted.

444
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,100
I don't think we understand the impact

445
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,838
of how much the opportunity is real,

446
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:02,020
and for me, it becomes
disproportionately compounded

447
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,050
because you're actually
at this conference.

448
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,752
You're actually part of a
very small interesting group

449
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:10,892
for me, which is, I know
how big the opportunity is,

450
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:14,357
I know that 99% of people
have no idea it's happening,

451
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:18,440
you do, so you're part
of 1% of the whole thing

452
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,729
that understands it's happening,

453
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,646
now it's yours to lose.

454
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,266
I would argue that if you are not able

455
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:28,670
to achieve what you
want to achieve in life,

456
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,661
and you're at this
conference during this time,

457
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:34,891
then you really mis-executed.

458
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:36,945
Then you really got into the things that

459
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:39,827
I worry about when I put out content,

460
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:42,070
which is you worry way too much about

461
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,910
stuff that does not matter.

462
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,169
That you're worried way too much

463
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:48,336
about other people's opinions,

464
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:50,650
which is the biggest reason
you don't take chances,

465
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,534
because you worry about how
people judge your failures,

466
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:57,193
then you're doing a lot of other things

467
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:59,349
that are leading to huge levels

468
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:02,766
of missed shots and missed opportunities,

469
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:06,548
and so that's why I speak so much

470
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:09,890
about being insular,
having the right intent,

471
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,792
because literally, fundamentally,

472
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:15,062
if you synthesize
everything I've just said,

473
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:18,531
non-action is the fundamental reason

474
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:21,744
that most of you will fail, at this point,

475
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:26,369
being in this room, at this
conference, during this time,

476
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:30,105
and understanding quite a bit
of what's actually happening.

477
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:34,030
Non-action, which if you
take all the way to the seed

478
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,613
of a human being is insecurity.

479
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:39,469
Which,

480
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:42,703
is probably the biggest
reason that I create content,

481
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:45,031
because I hope that you use me

482
00:23:45,031 --> 00:23:47,198
as your shield to do shit,

483
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:50,192
period.

484
00:23:50,192 --> 00:23:53,653
So, that's what I think is happening.

485
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:56,593
Audio's super interesting to me.

486
00:23:56,593 --> 00:24:00,760
Feed dynamics and a mobile
device are the currency today,

487
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:05,262
it will continue to be for a little while.

488
00:24:05,262 --> 00:24:07,852
Enormous things are happening around us

489
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:10,370
on blockchain and AR and
things of that nature,

490
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,949
they're all coming, they're
all circling around,

491
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:16,754
some things are much further
away than people realize,

492
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:20,921
I am very, very anti-consumer
VR in the short term.

493
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,601
If you asked me, this
great phenomenon that I'm

494
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:27,710
so obsessed with called the internet,

495
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,764
the only thing that
arbitrages it out is VR.

496
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:34,830
If we live in a full VR
world, then now what, right?

497
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,332
Cool, but nobody here
knows a single human being

498
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:42,131
that spends an hour in VR in a week.

499
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:43,988
Not for non-business purposes,

500
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:45,576
consumer behavior's not there.

501
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:48,310
My friends, for the people
that are the smartest

502
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,120
when it comes to tech in here,

503
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,611
the biggest thing that stops
you from being successful

504
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:56,370
is you understand that the tech is ready,

505
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,264
but you haven't factored
in consumer behavior.

506
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:02,956
The biggest reason that
so many super smart

507
00:25:02,956 --> 00:25:05,819
technologists fail with their products

508
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:09,536
is they anticipate techs and
they understand that it works,

509
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:12,571
there's so many things that work right now

510
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:15,210
that are four, seven, nine years away,

511
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,161
because we're not ready
to use it that way.

512
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:19,828
Online dating worked

513
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,943
in 1996,

514
00:25:23,228 --> 00:25:26,462
but it took another decade
before there was a stigma

515
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:30,546
removed from it that allowed
it to start having some legs,

516
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:35,205
and 10 years after that,
now it's mainstream, right?

517
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:37,659
That is basically what I do for a living,

518
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:41,262
day trading attention,
understanding behavior around it,

519
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:44,904
what are people gonna do
today that's meaningful

520
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:47,350
to the goals that we have?

521
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,532
Couple things that I wanna throw out

522
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:51,171
before we go into Q and A.

523
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:53,270
One thing that has come
up quite a bit today

524
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,881
since I've been doing
interviews and interacting

525
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:57,839
with people on social here in Singapore is

526
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,796
because I have a personal brand,

527
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:03,449
which, oh, by the way, is
such an interesting word,

528
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:07,297
'cause it gets people very
emotional in both directions,

529
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,122
I just wanna remind people that

530
00:26:09,122 --> 00:26:11,292
hate people with personal brands,

531
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:15,148
it's just a slang term
for your reputation.

532
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:19,939
So, people that have a
reputation or a personal brand,

533
00:26:19,939 --> 00:26:22,374
there's a lot of people asking me

534
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:25,491
if that's a requirement to
build a successful business,

535
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:29,977
and I find that laughable,
because I wanna remind everybody,

536
00:26:29,977 --> 00:26:34,144
I wanna remind everybody
that 99% of businesses

537
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,446
don't have a personal
brand in front of them.

538
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:43,059
You know, I think that
it's a great to have,

539
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,755
I think if you are
charismatic or narcissistic,

540
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:50,451
or enjoy the attention,
it's a nice to have,

541
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:53,776
I super love it, I love
taking selfies with you

542
00:26:53,776 --> 00:26:56,577
as much as you love taking it with me,

543
00:26:56,577 --> 00:26:59,202
it brings awareness, it's branding,

544
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,809
but it is far from the reason why one

545
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:05,565
would be successful and it's
definitely not a requirement

546
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:08,163
to be successful in today's
business environment.

547
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:12,153
The requirement to be
successful is very simple.

548
00:27:12,153 --> 00:27:15,028
Is your product good enough,

549
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:16,706
and do people know about it,

550
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:18,971
and do you have the
structure to get people

551
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,701
to know about it better than
the people you compete with

552
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:26,920
for the same share of attention
and money for that product.

553
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,490
It's very, very, very, very basic.

554
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,697
The biggest issue is, slash opportunity,

555
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:35,907
is the speed in which
it turns and changes.

556
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:40,001
And so, couple of the
things I wanna talk about.

557
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:42,834
Let's make it contextual to this audience.

558
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:45,372
I wanna remind most of you that you have

559
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,878
a disproportionate advantage

560
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:52,512
from most entrepreneurs
in the U.S., which is,

561
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:56,060
oftentimes, not always, because
of cultural differences,

562
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,175
but oftentimes, you get to see a preview

563
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:02,190
of what's happening before it happened.

564
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,821
When I think about my
friends that have built

565
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:07,295
successful businesses in southeast Asia

566
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:11,537
by simply paying attention of
what's happening in America

567
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:15,704
and then replicating some
version of it in the market,

568
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:19,990
it is literally the dream come true.

569
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,444
American entrepreneurs got mad
at those brothers in Germany,

570
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:27,983
right, who would rip off the
ideas and build a business.

571
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:30,214
I always was so upset about that.

572
00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:32,420
I mean, I think Facebook has proven

573
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,797
that there's no ripping
off if it's a feature,

574
00:28:36,797 --> 00:28:40,406
and I think I would also argue that

575
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:42,977
ripping off by looking
at a different business

576
00:28:42,977 --> 00:28:46,031
in a different market
and then interpreting it

577
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:49,416
into your market is far from ripping off,

578
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,583
I think it's called smart.

579
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:56,630
So, I would highly recommend,
I don't know if it's pride,

580
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,510
which I think holds back a lot of people,

581
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,239
but please take advantage
for the disadvantages

582
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:06,335
one could think they have,
there's only five million here,

583
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:08,415
if you wanna do it in Indonesia,

584
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,672
there's a lot of people but
there's so many microclimates,

585
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:12,798
so that's, so many
different segmentations,

586
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,965
mainly in China, whatever you
would deem a disadvantage,

587
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,716
please understand you have
the greatest advantage,

588
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:25,883
which is 90% of things
are human, not cultural.

589
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:31,013
90% of things are human, not cultural.

590
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:33,403
If you're capable of
understanding the culture

591
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:36,016
of your consumer and
layer the cultural context

592
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:40,757
on top of the human thing
that is happening in America,

593
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:42,893
you are halfway home.

594
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:44,976
An unbelievable advantage

595
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:48,845
to be an entrepreneur in this region,

596
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:51,567
and watch things play out,

597
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:54,777
by the way, for free, no report needed,

598
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:58,097
no hiring Boston Consulting
or Bain and McKinsey,

599
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:02,567
by reading and watching
videos and downloading apps,

600
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,813
something that I don't believe most people

601
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:07,988
in this conference are
taking full advantage of,

602
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:10,736
or respecting enough of
how big of an advantage

603
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:13,453
that is, and to me, very honestly,

604
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:16,270
I'm quite selfish when I speak,

605
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,559
I dream in three years
from now, you email me,

606
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,542
nothing would make me happier than

607
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:23,725
getting an email from
somebody here who said

608
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:27,273
they had a $50 million
exit, because, you know,

609
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:30,082
they just looked at what
was working in America,

610
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:33,582
and they built the replica-ish of it here.

611
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:38,008
Please do that, please understand
how big of a deal that is,

612
00:30:38,008 --> 00:30:41,782
and I would argue it is your
singular biggest advantage

613
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:45,757
in this market to be able
to be shown what will work,

614
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:48,300
and then allow you to interpret it,

615
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,063
oftentimes with very
little change in the model.

616
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:54,387
Cool?

617
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:55,969
Cool.

618
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:58,552
What else is interesting to me?

619
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:02,846
You know what's super interesting to me?

620
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:03,679
LinkedIn.

621
00:31:04,717 --> 00:31:07,024
Let me talk about LinkedIn for a second.

622
00:31:07,024 --> 00:31:09,513
How many people here are on LinkedIn?

623
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:11,263
Good, this will work.

624
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:14,074
LinkedIn's interesting to me.

625
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:17,576
I think LinkedIn is up to something

626
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,511
that I think will be
beneficial for a lot of us.

627
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,041
First of all, how many
people are in B2B marketing?

628
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,337
Raise your hands.

629
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:24,863
So, look, raise them higher,

630
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:28,431
because I see a lot of
half assed hands, higher.

631
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:30,165
Great, two hands, nice.

632
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:30,998
B2B.

633
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:34,633
I've said this before, I'll say it again,

634
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:37,023
'cause I'm not sure
how many have heard it.

635
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:39,232
Here's how I think about B2B marketing.

636
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,133
In every one of our B2B spaces,

637
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,300
there's usually a magazine or two

638
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,233
that is the leading B2B
magazine in our sector, right?

639
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:50,482
There's just a B2B magazine
that our customers read.

640
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:53,663
I think that's the thing
that you should attack.

641
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:57,061
I think you, as a company and a service,

642
00:31:57,061 --> 00:32:00,432
should look at the B2B
magazine and deem that

643
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:03,315
your competitor, more than
people you compete with

644
00:32:03,315 --> 00:32:07,009
to sell contracts to
clients, let me explain.

645
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,957
It is my belief that everybody in here

646
00:32:08,957 --> 00:32:11,207
is no longer an advertiser,

647
00:32:12,252 --> 00:32:16,911
but that everybody in
here is a media company.

648
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:19,231
So, I know a lot of you have heard me say

649
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:23,267
don't listen to what I'm
saying, watch what I'm doing.

650
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:27,100
I don't advertise, I act
like a media company,

651
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:31,349
and then from that, I
have top of the funnel

652
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,734
brand awareness that leads to my business.

653
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,901
I don't buy ads on Ad Age,

654
00:32:37,044 --> 00:32:40,473
I don't sponsor things that can,

655
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:43,024
I produce content with my points of view,

656
00:32:43,024 --> 00:32:44,478
act like a media company,

657
00:32:44,478 --> 00:32:47,139
and they funnel into an
environment where I built

658
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,722
$125 million in revenue in AdWorld

659
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:52,139
without winning a single RFP.

660
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:53,966
Right?

661
00:32:55,082 --> 00:32:58,736
So, I don't know what all of
you do in your B2B business,

662
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:02,393
but I would look at why
people read the B2B magazine,

663
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:05,053
and I would argue that
you need to start becoming

664
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:07,636
a media company for the sector,

665
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:11,742
and then trading off of the
top of the funnel awareness.

666
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,321
Let me explain again.

667
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:17,034
In 2006, this happened to me intuitively.

668
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:19,168
I started a wine show on YouTube

669
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:21,630
less than a year after
YouTube was launched.

670
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,533
I thought that I was
gonna make infomercials.

671
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:28,933
I thought my main plan when
there was a camera like that

672
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:31,264
in my office for episode one was

673
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:35,033
I was gonna sit there and sell you wine.

674
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,111
Something very interesting happened,

675
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:39,386
if you wanna go on YouTube
and watch episode one

676
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:41,980
of Wine Library TV, somewhere
in the first three minutes,

677
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,345
you can even see my face
take a little weird turn,

678
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:46,357
you can see me thinking,

679
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,734
because I realized that
this would never go away,

680
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:51,900
that this video would live forever,

681
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,159
and I realized that if I was shilling wine

682
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,990
that I didn't believe in,
that I could be exposed.

683
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,797
So, somewhere within
the first three minutes

684
00:33:59,797 --> 00:34:02,455
of me ever producing a piece
of content for the internet

685
00:34:02,455 --> 00:34:06,122
in my life, I switched
from being a salesman

686
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:10,413
to being a media company.

687
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:13,888
I would argue that most of the behavior

688
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,387
in the way that you produce content

689
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,554
has short term sales DNA
versus long term media DNA.

690
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:24,688
And this is the vulnerability
of why you're not getting

691
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:28,252
the returns that you're looking
for from this environment.

692
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:32,079
So, I would, please, implore
a lot of you to realize that

693
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,106
I believe one of the first
hires of your business

694
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:40,500
in the future is your editor
in chief of your business.

695
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,000
An actual media editor for a SaaS product,

696
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:48,721
or a consultancy firm, or whatever you do,

697
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:53,437
and so, this media mindset
is super fascinating.

698
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:57,548
Let me explain it in an
even more historical nature.

699
00:34:57,548 --> 00:35:01,205
Do you guys know that
the Michelin Tire Company

700
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:02,705
in the early 1900s

701
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:08,858
decided to start writing reviews
of hotels and restaurants

702
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:12,705
in the countrysides of
Europe because people

703
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:15,737
weren't driving enough
and using up the tires

704
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:18,291
and stopping in their gas stations,

705
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,003
so they started reviewing
restaurants and inns

706
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:26,841
positively if they were further
away from London and Paris

707
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:29,333
to get the wealthy to drive out there

708
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:32,752
and stop by their stations
and use up their tires,

709
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:35,198
and that is why we, to this day,

710
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:39,588
have restaurants rated
three stars Michelin,

711
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:43,223
because the Michelin Tire
Company, 100 years ago,

712
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:45,056
executed on my thesis.

713
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:50,078
In the same vein, Guinness beer company,

714
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:53,469
after declining in pubs for the first time

715
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:55,842
around the same time,

716
00:35:55,842 --> 00:35:58,230
realized that a lot of people were

717
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,058
talking about trivia at the bar,

718
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:04,813
and literally created the
Guinness Book of World Records

719
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:08,896
to get you to talk about
crazy records and trivia

720
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:13,411
in a pub and use the word Guinness,

721
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:15,950
so that you would subconsciously reorder

722
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,783
a Guinness in the pub.

723
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:22,614
This is super interesting to me.

724
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,556
I'm a very big believer that the future

725
00:36:25,556 --> 00:36:28,306
has all of its seeds in the past.

726
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:32,251
And so, I implore all of
you to become much better

727
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:35,084
historians around how to use media

728
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:39,945
as a top of the funnel gateway

729
00:36:39,945 --> 00:36:42,145
to sales around your business.

730
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:44,043
Once you understand that,

731
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:47,850
you will find far more success in LinkedIn

732
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,279
if you write a white
paper that helps lawyers

733
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:53,736
run their business and
then it's a gateway drug

734
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:55,569
to what you sell them,

735
00:36:56,825 --> 00:37:00,465
than if you were to try to
just sell them an ad saying

736
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:03,548
free consultation if you use my firm.

737
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:07,625
Media DNA versus advertising DNA.

738
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:14,175
Media, again, you want
distribution in retail stores?

739
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:18,257
Write a white paper on LinkedIn,

740
00:37:18,257 --> 00:37:21,924
15 things that retailers
need to do in 2018,

741
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:25,273
brought to you by your brand,

742
00:37:25,273 --> 00:37:27,692
I promise you, you'll
be stunned by how much

743
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:31,775
inbound opportunity you
have in that environment.

744
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:34,763
Media, not advertising.

745
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,486
So, those are some of the
top of the funnel things

746
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:40,039
that are really on my mind.

747
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,372
I continue to execute, I continue to do,

748
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:47,033
I'm very fascinated by how much time

749
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:50,655
people spend dwelling and debating,

750
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:55,449
I think we glorify strategy
and we underestimate execution.

751
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:57,696
I feel like if you look historically

752
00:37:57,696 --> 00:37:59,920
and rewind the biggest successes,

753
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,355
the strategy came from the execution,

754
00:38:02,355 --> 00:38:04,737
and you did some Monday
morning quarterback,

755
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:07,186
I'm a real genius, in hindsight,

756
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:11,523
because I can manipulate how
I got there after the fact.

757
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:14,583
I'm gonna talk about so many
things in different ways

758
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,668
than the intent that it was at first,

759
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:18,723
because you don't even
realize that your strategy

760
00:38:18,723 --> 00:38:21,130
came from it, because when you're doing,

761
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,334
the strategy is happening in realtime,

762
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,786
you almost forget why you were
doing it in the first place,

763
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:31,227
and so I promise you,
indecisiveness and debate

764
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:34,169
and pontificating and ultimately, ego,

765
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:37,416
is stopping so many people
from being successful.

766
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,350
And while I'm on that,

767
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,117
how many people have
more than 10 employees,

768
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,020
raise your hand.

769
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,291
Great, I think it's worth bringing up.

770
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,124
Hiring.

771
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:51,031
I'm super passionate about hiring.

772
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:52,731
How many people have
more than 10 employees,

773
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,808
raise your hands.

774
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:59,141
I think one of the biggest
flaws in most of your companies

775
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:02,195
is your own ego wrapped
up in being somebody

776
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:04,028
that's good at hiring.

777
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:06,374
I wanna tell this story,

778
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:07,638
'cause I think it's one of the most

779
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:10,817
fascinating things happening
in small businesses.

780
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:13,631
I'm stunned by how many small businesses,

781
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:18,503
CEOs, founders, or owners
think they're good at hiring,

782
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:21,563
and have made this a thing.

783
00:39:21,563 --> 00:39:23,928
They've made it a thing
'cause they wrap their pride

784
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,304
in hiring, and here's what happens.

785
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:31,471
I feel like my EQ and people
skills are off the charts.

786
00:39:32,543 --> 00:39:35,360
I am baffled by how many horrible hires

787
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,489
I've made in the last 20 years.

788
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:39,322
A lot.

789
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,186
So, when I think about my
intuition and ability and process

790
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:47,340
and deploy that against the masses,

791
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,490
I know a lot of you have made huge

792
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,448
amounts of mistakes hiring.

793
00:39:52,448 --> 00:39:56,365
I so don't give a crap
what you think about me,

794
00:39:57,494 --> 00:39:59,962
that I'm very comfortable
and excited about

795
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:04,785
admitting that I was wrong
and firing very quickly.

796
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:08,726
Most people sit on
people for a year or two,

797
00:40:08,726 --> 00:40:10,892
because they don't wanna be exposed

798
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:14,574
at making a wrong
decision, and in that time,

799
00:40:14,574 --> 00:40:18,960
enormous amounts of bad stuff
happens to your business.

800
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,494
So, and a completely random thing

801
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:23,825
from what I've been talking about,

802
00:40:23,825 --> 00:40:27,314
if I can get one person
here to fire the person

803
00:40:27,314 --> 00:40:29,661
they should be firing in
their business right now,

804
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,206
after today, I will feel very accomplished

805
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:34,789
on my entire trip to Singapore.

806
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,896
Who's got a question?

807
00:40:43,896 --> 00:40:44,729
Great.

808
00:40:48,275 --> 00:40:50,650
You see that, that was good accuracy.

809
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,570
What's your name?

810
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,403
- [Man] Melvin.

811
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:53,236
- Melvin.

812
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:56,001
- [Melvin] Yeah, and first
off, I would wanna say,

813
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:57,899
Gary, thank you so much,

814
00:40:57,899 --> 00:41:01,649
because of what you did,
you changed my life.

815
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:04,732
If you remember, slightly
earlier this year,

816
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:08,880
you started a contest on TV--
- 2017 Flip Challenge?

817
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,032
- [Melvin] No, the GV, GV Podcast Contest.

818
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:13,652
- Yes.
- Yes.

819
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:16,220
So, at the point, I'm almost in the U.S.,

820
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,849
and I knew that by the time
that that thing's gonna happen,

821
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:22,602
I will be in New Jersey, New York,

822
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:24,712
so I was hustling really hard to get you

823
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,838
to pay attention me,
obviously it didn't happen.

824
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:30,201
- Yes.
- Yeah, alright, but,

825
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:32,550
but the good part was that what I did was

826
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,872
I did exactly what you told me to do,

827
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:36,784
or what you had been saying.

828
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:38,617
So, I had the hashtag,

829
00:41:39,836 --> 00:41:44,003
I started tweeting everyone
who submitted their entry,

830
00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:47,343
and I said, congratulations, I asked them,

831
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:50,261
this is my favorite Gary
Vee quote, what's yours,

832
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,715
and then I started getting reply.

833
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:55,630
And so, that was when I got a reply,

834
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,462
and that was when I restarted
my vlogging journey again,

835
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:02,867
so this is the third time I've
started my vlogging journey.

836
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:05,240
So, this time when I
started my vlogging journey,

837
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,457
boom, it happened.

838
00:42:07,457 --> 00:42:09,614
People started paying attention,

839
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:14,085
I think you know him, Chris
Brogan, pay attention to me,

840
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:16,646
he tweet a lot my videos,

841
00:42:16,646 --> 00:42:18,372
he even jump on a call with me

842
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:21,249
to do an interview, so that was great.

843
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:22,275
- That's awesome, he's a good guy.

844
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:24,219
- [Melvin] Yeah, so, first off,

845
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,640
I wanted to thank you for ignoring me,

846
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,241
because if you hadn't ignored me,

847
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:30,887
I wouldn't have thought of that.

848
00:42:30,887 --> 00:42:31,763
- I love it.

849
00:42:31,763 --> 00:42:33,126
- [Melvin] Yeah, so that's one.

850
00:42:33,126 --> 00:42:34,861
Now, number two is that I think there are

851
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:36,060
three things that we have in common.

852
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,132
Number one, we have the
same favorite number.

853
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:39,105
- Five.
- Number,

854
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:41,847
number two, we have this, we
are born in the same month.

855
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:43,924
- Nice, November.
- Yeah, alright,

856
00:42:43,924 --> 00:42:46,828
so, the other thing is,
I wanna say is that,

857
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:51,055
when I started my vlogging
again, this time around.

858
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:52,929
- Third time.
- I started getting attention,

859
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:54,505
and I started getting discovered,

860
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,290
and now companies start calling me,

861
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,544
people start calling me and say that

862
00:42:57,544 --> 00:42:59,449
can you do videos for me?

863
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:03,032
So, now I'm here today,
and I'm devastated.

864
00:43:04,194 --> 00:43:06,957
Why, because you are talking about audio.

865
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:10,473
(everyone laughing)

866
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:11,473
Alright?
- Yes.

867
00:43:11,473 --> 00:43:13,459
- [Melvin] So, my question is, right now,

868
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:16,855
I'm beginning to crush it,
if you know this actually,

869
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:19,633
I said to you earlier on
Twitter that I'm not coming here

870
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:22,002
because I'm executing on what
you say and I'm crushing it,

871
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:25,549
I have no time, but I'm here
today because I wanna see you,

872
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:27,026
I wanna say thank you to you.

873
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:28,277
- Thank you.
- And so,

874
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:30,157
my question to you, it's basically this.

875
00:43:30,157 --> 00:43:32,489
For someone who is really getting traction

876
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:35,300
in terms of video, people
started paying attention.

877
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,590
- Both.
- Well, yeah,

878
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,780
yeah, I know.
- Both.

879
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,495
- [Melvin] But would I be, would I be,

880
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:40,748
so what would the--
- Both.

881
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:41,900
- [Melvin] Strategy be?

882
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,733
- Both.

883
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:43,691
- [Melvin] What would the strategy be,

884
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:45,354
what would I do with podcasts?

885
00:43:45,354 --> 00:43:46,265
- I don't know.

886
00:43:46,265 --> 00:43:48,064
(audience laughing)

887
00:43:48,064 --> 00:43:49,657
- Okay.
- But let's talk about it.

888
00:43:49,657 --> 00:43:51,240
- Okay.
- First answer is both.

889
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,546
- [Melvin] Okay, obviously.

890
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,825
- Now, let me rephrase, it
depends on your ambition.

891
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:58,637
First of all, I love
going deep on what works.

892
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:02,460
Just 'cause audio's rising
doesn't mean video's dead.

893
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,021
You know, it's so funny,

894
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:06,270
we've been the same for a very long time.

895
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,876
We, as humans, consume
content in written form,

896
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:11,793
in audio, and in video.

897
00:44:13,438 --> 00:44:17,214
Whether it's TV, newspaper, or radio,

898
00:44:17,214 --> 00:44:20,141
or blogs, podcasts, and YouTube,

899
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:21,968
it's the same game.

900
00:44:21,968 --> 00:44:23,968
So, nothing's gonna die.

901
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:27,112
If you have real ambition
to build a personal brand

902
00:44:27,112 --> 00:44:29,477
that you wanna arbitrage opportunities on,

903
00:44:29,477 --> 00:44:30,984
my answer is both,

904
00:44:30,984 --> 00:44:35,156
because in 16 hours,
you can get a lot done.

905
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:37,299
You know, people always
say to me, do you sleep,

906
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,441
and this and that, Gary's
always pushing no sleep,

907
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:41,285
I mean, if you follow me carefully,

908
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:44,111
I talk about six, seven,
eight hours, sleep!

909
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:46,136
I'm not worried about you sleeping,

910
00:44:46,136 --> 00:44:49,520
I'm worried about what you're
doing when you're awake.

911
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,050
16 hours is a lot of time to do damage,

912
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,449
and so, what would you do on your podcast?

913
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:59,047
Look what I did at first.

914
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:01,960
I believed in audio about
a year and a half ago,

915
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,212
I wanted to get in, I was busy,

916
00:45:04,212 --> 00:45:06,336
I didn't have the
infrastructure I have now,

917
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,422
so what did I do?

918
00:45:07,422 --> 00:45:11,483
I transcribed the Ask Gary
Vee video show into audio,

919
00:45:11,483 --> 00:45:15,469
right, then I watched it,
it wasn't enough value add,

920
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:18,920
and it was made for video, so
it wasn't contextual to audio,

921
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,389
so my podcast was not
doing as well as it could.

922
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:25,611
Then on vacation, where I
had a little time to think,

923
00:45:25,611 --> 00:45:29,237
I decided to rebrand it to
the Gary Vee Audio Experience,

924
00:45:29,237 --> 00:45:31,295
which gave me a lot more flexibility

925
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,599
to give you guys original
content that you didn't

926
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,277
hear anywhere else, keynotes,

927
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:37,957
different things, and it took off.

928
00:45:37,957 --> 00:45:40,476
You have to look at yourself
of what you're capable

929
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:42,660
of doing, especially when
you're a one man band,

930
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,819
and I don't know if you have
anybody helping you yet.

931
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:45,847
- [Melvin] Not yet, right now.

932
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:47,929
- So, as a one man band, what I would do,

933
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:51,343
is if you're vlogging, every day,

934
00:45:51,343 --> 00:45:54,570
I would take 10 minutes of
something that you're doing

935
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,924
or talking about, not
show it in video form,

936
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:01,171
rip the audio, and make that your podcast.

937
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:02,443
- [Melvin] Got it.

938
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:03,317
Thank you.

939
00:46:03,317 --> 00:46:05,854
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

940
00:46:05,854 --> 00:46:08,202
- Can you pass it on to the next question?

941
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:09,035
Question?

942
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,078
Your aim is not where we're the same.

943
00:46:14,078 --> 00:46:17,078
(audience laughing)

944
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:18,989
- [Kenneth] Hi, Gary.

945
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:19,822
- [Gary] How are you?

946
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:20,690
- [Kenneth] My name is Kenneth, so.

947
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,653
- [Gary] How are you?

948
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,287
- [Kenneth] I'm very good,
very good, how about you?

949
00:46:23,287 --> 00:46:24,655
- [Gary] Super.

950
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:25,583
- Good to see you here,

951
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,094
I would like to say a
big thank you to you,

952
00:46:27,094 --> 00:46:29,793
although I did not follow you for years,

953
00:46:29,793 --> 00:46:33,421
but in the past six months,
a lot of things have changed.

954
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:36,370
I'm writing a book, it's
called Modern Industrialist.

955
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,081
I, in fact, emailed you, but
I guess I have not hustled

956
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:41,773
enough to email you a lot of times,

957
00:46:41,773 --> 00:46:44,650
but because of that,
of you ignoring again,

958
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,811
I realized that I need to do something,

959
00:46:46,811 --> 00:46:50,330
and I took the action of
document versus create.

960
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:53,694
Because, for me, I'm a
marketer, marketing consultant,

961
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:56,115
I always think of crazy ideas, but,

962
00:46:56,115 --> 00:46:58,005
and I don't go into documenting.

963
00:46:58,005 --> 00:47:00,813
So what I did is, because of
my book, Modern Industrialist,

964
00:47:00,813 --> 00:47:03,537
I interviewed 15 mompreneurs that I put

965
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:06,382
into my book that I personally know,

966
00:47:06,382 --> 00:47:09,336
and because moms love to share,
they start referring mom,

967
00:47:09,336 --> 00:47:12,797
other mompreneurs, but I could
not put them into the book,

968
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:15,453
and that's where I created
my Facebook Live With Lee

969
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:18,429
every Monday, and I
document it, document it,

970
00:47:18,429 --> 00:47:21,537
and I interview them, and
it's growing and growing.

971
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:25,537
So, my question to you
is how should I bring it,

972
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,724
scale it up from there, and personally,

973
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:32,161
I own a creative marketing company,

974
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:34,494
so how do I put it together?

975
00:47:35,701 --> 00:47:38,190
- So, you wanna figure out
how to use the leverage

976
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,475
of the weekly show to build on top of?

977
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:42,729
- [Kenneth] Yep.

978
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:44,168
- What would you like to happen?

979
00:47:44,168 --> 00:47:46,057
Would you like it to be a gateway drug

980
00:47:46,057 --> 00:47:47,370
to your creative shop,

981
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:50,855
do you wanna build a SaaS
product for mompreneurs?

982
00:47:50,855 --> 00:47:52,900
Or do you wanna become a personal brand

983
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,153
and live as being the human
that makes enough dollars?

984
00:47:56,153 --> 00:47:58,657
I think you have a lot of
flexibility of what you can do,

985
00:47:58,657 --> 00:48:01,814
but this is where you
have to start backwards.

986
00:48:01,814 --> 00:48:04,921
So, for me, the reason
I think I'm winning is,

987
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:07,817
for me, backwards, I'm more
interested in my legacy

988
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:10,638
than making money, which
is why all of you like me,

989
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,782
because I'm trying to win
you over by giving you value,

990
00:48:13,782 --> 00:48:15,521
not get a short term sale,

991
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:18,041
which is why it's building legacy.

992
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:20,428
So, all my behaviors work backwards.

993
00:48:20,428 --> 00:48:23,392
I just gave you in one
second three viable options

994
00:48:23,392 --> 00:48:24,847
on the back of this,

995
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:28,118
do you have a clear answer to that,

996
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:29,789
or is that something you need to debate?

997
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:31,445
- [Kenneth] I,

998
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:34,787
because there's a lot
options that I could do,

999
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,556
which I'm working on,

1000
00:48:36,556 --> 00:48:40,254
but it's not coming back
to me as fast, because.

1001
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:42,340
- How long have you been
doing the live show?

1002
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,256
- [Kenneth] I'm doing episode 15,

1003
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:46,996
so I'm going for my 16 of
doing on a weekly basis.

1004
00:48:46,996 --> 00:48:48,521
- Hold on, one, five?

1005
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:50,143
- [Kenneth] One, five, yes, yes.

1006
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:52,682
I just started, yeah.

1007
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:54,493
So, because of that, yeah.

1008
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:57,158
So, I'm going on and on, I'm not stopping,

1009
00:48:57,158 --> 00:48:59,789
and it's growing, and
it's not just locally,

1010
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:02,154
it's also into U.S. and a lot of traction,

1011
00:49:02,154 --> 00:49:03,364
people start referring.

1012
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:04,830
- Yeah, it's called Facebook.
- Yes.

1013
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,219
Yeah, so, I'm continuing that,

1014
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:10,860
and getting a lot of traction,
getting partners coming,

1015
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,902
and also to sponsor for my book,

1016
00:49:12,902 --> 00:49:15,423
so that's what I'm working towards,

1017
00:49:15,423 --> 00:49:17,510
and I would also like
what you have mentioned,

1018
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:21,677
is to put it as a media, so
I'm also attracting partners,

1019
00:49:23,188 --> 00:49:26,785
companies, to come in, to maybe, like,

1020
00:49:26,785 --> 00:49:28,519
mompreneurs, they have their own business.

1021
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:29,479
- Can I give you a good piece

1022
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:30,904
of advice that's good for everybody?

1023
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:31,737
- [Kenneth] Yep.

1024
00:49:31,737 --> 00:49:34,547
- The sooner you monetize,

1025
00:49:34,547 --> 00:49:37,630
the quicker you give up the leverage.

1026
00:49:38,594 --> 00:49:41,081
- [Kenneth] The question
is how to monetize.

1027
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:42,180
- Yeah, I understand.

1028
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,013
So, and the answer is,

1029
00:49:45,384 --> 00:49:47,175
I really wish you didn't give a shit

1030
00:49:47,175 --> 00:49:50,024
about monetizing just yet.

1031
00:49:50,024 --> 00:49:53,364
So, you know, there's a
lot of ways to monetize.

1032
00:49:53,364 --> 00:49:57,685
You just rattled off several,
and I rattled off several.

1033
00:49:57,685 --> 00:49:59,881
So, I don't think you have an,

1034
00:49:59,881 --> 00:50:04,347
are you having trouble
closing the opportunities?

1035
00:50:04,347 --> 00:50:06,046
- [Kenneth] I guess
the struggle is because

1036
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,630
I wanna bring up value,

1037
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,682
I wanna push this mompreneur
movement all around,

1038
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:13,823
and to drive this, rather than
focusing on the monetizing,

1039
00:50:13,823 --> 00:50:16,603
but monetizing is still
our bread and butter.

1040
00:50:16,603 --> 00:50:17,756
That's why--
- But they're very

1041
00:50:17,756 --> 00:50:19,047
different things, right?

1042
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:21,066
One of the things that
really works for me is

1043
00:50:21,066 --> 00:50:23,340
I don't wanna monetize any of you,

1044
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:28,160
I have an agency that works
with the top 100 brands, right?

1045
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,806
So, couldn't you monetize
with what you're doing

1046
00:50:31,806 --> 00:50:36,123
and continue to build equity
with the mompreneur community?

1047
00:50:36,123 --> 00:50:38,052
- [Kenneth] I could do that, just that,

1048
00:50:38,052 --> 00:50:39,519
I have to speed up, and also.

1049
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:41,102
- But why speed up?

1050
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:44,731
Dude, you've done 15 episodes.

1051
00:50:44,731 --> 00:50:46,648
You're four seconds in.

1052
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:50,537
What are you trying, where are you going?

1053
00:50:50,537 --> 00:50:51,870
What's the rush?

1054
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,050
I mean, that's the punchline.

1055
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:56,883
Right?

1056
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,460
Do you think it's gonna go away,

1057
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,538
do you think you found some
sort of rare, you know,

1058
00:51:02,538 --> 00:51:06,187
pot at the end of the rainbow
that's gonna disappear?

1059
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:07,104
I'm asking.

1060
00:51:08,634 --> 00:51:11,035
- [Kenneth] I feel that's unique,

1061
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:13,720
coming from a man, coming from a dad,

1062
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,643
interviewing mompreneurs.

1063
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:16,665
- So, what, are you scared about a bunch

1064
00:51:16,665 --> 00:51:19,558
of dudes here trying to
talk to the mompreneurs?

1065
00:51:19,558 --> 00:51:20,808
- [Kenneth] No.

1066
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:25,634
So, I guess it's to, to
find out, to find out what,

1067
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:28,459
because I have my own
creative marketing company,

1068
00:51:28,459 --> 00:51:30,806
it's like what you've
been doing, VaynerMedia,

1069
00:51:30,806 --> 00:51:33,585
you're doing your
business, at the same time,

1070
00:51:33,585 --> 00:51:36,752
I feel that being an
author, writing my book,

1071
00:51:36,752 --> 00:51:40,783
interviewing mompreneurs, is
kind of like my Superman time,

1072
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:43,750
that I get to do all this
thing, which I love to do it,

1073
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,123
but at the same time, I
have to be Clark Kent,

1074
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:49,605
I have to do all the work
and get my bills paid,

1075
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:51,085
which is fine, but.
- The problem is,

1076
00:51:51,085 --> 00:51:54,668
you can't monetize
Superman to be Superman.

1077
00:51:57,628 --> 00:51:59,567
You followed?
- Yes.

1078
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:01,168
- That's the problem.

1079
00:52:01,168 --> 00:52:03,946
You're trying to sell a
logo on Superman's suit,

1080
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:06,779
and it's gonna look really stupid.

1081
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:10,506
You following, or no?

1082
00:52:10,506 --> 00:52:11,658
- [Kenneth] Yep.

1083
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:12,491
I get it.

1084
00:52:12,491 --> 00:52:14,170
- The answer is, you don't monetize it.

1085
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,280
- [Kenneth] Got it.

1086
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,373
Thanks.
- Because,

1087
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:19,264
because two things will happen.

1088
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:22,475
One, you're still gonna
monetize as Clark Kent.

1089
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:24,918
I spent, do you watch Daily Vee at all?

1090
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:25,840
- [Kenneth] Yes, yes.

1091
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,223
- You know how I always talk about, like,

1092
00:52:27,223 --> 00:52:30,395
you're not seeing any of
it, 'cause you're not.

1093
00:52:30,395 --> 00:52:32,565
13 hours a day that you see nothing of,

1094
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:34,667
me in meetings with clients,

1095
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:37,576
sometimes I'll do a fast
music and, just to show you,

1096
00:52:37,576 --> 00:52:39,200
just to remind you I'm
actually doing, but,

1097
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,577
I don't think it's super fun content,

1098
00:52:41,577 --> 00:52:43,536
I think it's a waste of
your time to watch me

1099
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:46,619
in B roll be in 11 hours of meetings.

1100
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:51,037
You know, I'm very good
at being Clark Kent,

1101
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:54,076
and I have no interest
in monetizing Superman,

1102
00:52:54,076 --> 00:52:56,149
you're trying to monetize Superman,

1103
00:52:56,149 --> 00:52:58,641
which is gonna be the undoing of both.

1104
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:00,741
- [Kenneth] Got it, yep, I understand.

1105
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:01,908
- Cool.
- Okay.

1106
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:08,920
- [Radul] Hey, hi, Gary, my name is Radul.

1107
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,991
- How are you?

1108
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,192
- [Radul] Very pleased to be here,

1109
00:53:11,192 --> 00:53:13,396
and also, I need to start
by saying big thank you,

1110
00:53:13,396 --> 00:53:16,704
because I've been following
you for about one year, maybe?

1111
00:53:16,704 --> 00:53:17,757
- Thank you.

1112
00:53:17,757 --> 00:53:20,982
- [Radul] But really needed
some of those principles.

1113
00:53:20,982 --> 00:53:22,853
Maybe I read too many bullshit stories

1114
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:24,898
of get rich overnight and kind of,

1115
00:53:24,898 --> 00:53:27,104
I was having that illusion in my brain

1116
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:29,142
that it's supposed to be fast,

1117
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:31,187
and I think that the top
thing that I took from you

1118
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:33,090
is that, look, it takes time.

1119
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,242
- Yeah, it's really interesting, right,

1120
00:53:34,242 --> 00:53:36,130
because my personality,

1121
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,858
and I'm sure some of you
felt this the first time

1122
00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:41,608
you saw me, my personality
seems so bullshit.

1123
00:53:45,074 --> 00:53:47,313
(audience laughing)

1124
00:53:47,313 --> 00:53:50,165
And it's ended up being
my biggest strength.

1125
00:53:50,165 --> 00:53:53,678
Because I have that kind of pizazz that

1126
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:56,915
all the bullshit people say
it's gonna happen fast have,

1127
00:53:56,915 --> 00:53:58,947
I'm able to get your attention,

1128
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:01,245
and then I trick you into going slow.

1129
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:03,912
And then you actually get what you want.

1130
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:05,600
- [Radul] Yeah.

1131
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,754
It works.

1132
00:54:06,754 --> 00:54:08,422
I guarantee.
- Sure does.

1133
00:54:08,422 --> 00:54:10,178
- [Radul] So, thank
you very much for that.

1134
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:11,933
My question is, and I'll work through it,

1135
00:54:11,933 --> 00:54:13,963
'cause I'm not sure I have
it clearly in my head.

1136
00:54:13,963 --> 00:54:17,607
So, basically, I've been
doing headhunting and

1137
00:54:17,607 --> 00:54:20,356
human resources, executive
search, for about four years.

1138
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:21,246
- I like it.

1139
00:54:21,246 --> 00:54:22,703
- [Radul] Very specific to a field,

1140
00:54:22,703 --> 00:54:24,205
which is supply chain and logistics.

1141
00:54:24,205 --> 00:54:25,164
- I like that, too.

1142
00:54:25,164 --> 00:54:26,736
- [Radul] I started a podcast about

1143
00:54:26,736 --> 00:54:29,830
two or three months ago,
which is going really well.

1144
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:30,768
- That makes sense.
- It's called Leaders

1145
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,520
in Supply Chain, so I'm
trying to do what you--

1146
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,236
- Let me tell you why I think that,

1147
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:38,095
notice how I said that
makes sense, super narrow,

1148
00:54:38,095 --> 00:54:41,219
you know what's so funny, it's
how I think about Singapore.

1149
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:42,658
I think having five million citizens

1150
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:45,841
is the advantage, not the disadvantage.

1151
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:47,723
Everybody's so quick to build here,

1152
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:50,691
and then go and do
Indonesia and other parts,

1153
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:52,993
that you forget that if you win the entire

1154
00:54:52,993 --> 00:54:56,895
five million market, you
have a real business.

1155
00:54:56,895 --> 00:54:58,478
I love podcasts in,

1156
00:54:59,347 --> 00:55:01,948
in very narrow, supply
chain, are you kidding,

1157
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,906
nobody, everybody thinks
they have to make, like,

1158
00:55:03,906 --> 00:55:05,925
consumer, the meanwhile is,

1159
00:55:05,925 --> 00:55:10,092
if you get the right 800
people listening to your, 800,

1160
00:55:10,948 --> 00:55:12,847
if you get the right 800 people listening

1161
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:17,081
to your podcast, your headhunting
business is gonna explode.

1162
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:19,183
- [Radul] Yeah, and it's starting,

1163
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:21,683
but I guess it's just the, so,

1164
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:25,065
I think it will need a
little bit more time,

1165
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:26,553
but it's happening because I'm engaging

1166
00:55:26,553 --> 00:55:28,742
with really C level people that,

1167
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,295
'cause it's also creating that platform

1168
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:32,757
that this industry
doesn't have, currently.

1169
00:55:32,757 --> 00:55:36,603
- It also is media, so your
ability to email somebody

1170
00:55:36,603 --> 00:55:39,768
who's the decision maker
at a company to be a guest,

1171
00:55:39,768 --> 00:55:42,963
who nobody would ask to
be a guest of anything,

1172
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:46,054
and now they become aware
of what you do on the side,

1173
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:50,166
give Superman away for free,
watch Clark Kent make money.

1174
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:51,185
- [Radul] Yeah.

1175
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:53,784
So, I guess all of this is happening,

1176
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:57,004
I think it needs still a bit
of time, a lot more time.

1177
00:55:57,004 --> 00:55:58,256
- Of course.

1178
00:55:58,256 --> 00:55:59,440
- [Radul] But I guess where I'm,

1179
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,061
I'm kind of struggling over,

1180
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:03,055
I guess what my question
is, so, on one side,

1181
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,301
we are selling headhunting.

1182
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:06,137
So, basically, you recruit
the best for your business.

1183
00:56:06,137 --> 00:56:07,440
- I understand.
- Which is HR.

1184
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,934
Then, on the other side,

1185
00:56:08,934 --> 00:56:10,394
I'm specialist in an industry

1186
00:56:10,394 --> 00:56:13,589
which is logistics supply chain.

1187
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:15,992
So then I'm kind of, 'cause
sometimes also people,

1188
00:56:15,992 --> 00:56:18,479
especially if it's very senior level,

1189
00:56:18,479 --> 00:56:20,329
so I've been getting
with some board levels,

1190
00:56:20,329 --> 00:56:22,933
but I went on the side
of the podcast to them,

1191
00:56:22,933 --> 00:56:25,126
and then they don't necessarily remember,

1192
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:26,862
they remember, okay,
that's the podcast guy,

1193
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:28,546
they don't remember you
as the headhunting guy.

1194
00:56:28,546 --> 00:56:29,441
- Yep.

1195
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:30,633
- [Radul] So, during the podcast,

1196
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:32,119
I do the bit on the industry,

1197
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:34,792
I do the bit on the HR, how
do you recruit your people,

1198
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:37,643
and I try to make that connection.

1199
00:56:37,643 --> 00:56:39,722
So, I guess where I'm struggling with,

1200
00:56:39,722 --> 00:56:41,893
and I don't know what's the
best way moving forward,

1201
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:43,134
I think it's gonna work if I keep it

1202
00:56:43,134 --> 00:56:44,859
to supply chain and logistics,

1203
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,846
I'm also considering,
shall I keep it to Asia,

1204
00:56:46,846 --> 00:56:50,112
so, expanded, and saying,
doing business in Asia,

1205
00:56:50,112 --> 00:56:52,779
to make it a little bit broader.

1206
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:55,699
- I mean, you mean the show?

1207
00:56:55,699 --> 00:56:56,950
- [Radul] Yeah.

1208
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,151
And also the business, then I can also,

1209
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:00,074
I can then bring the headhunting business

1210
00:57:00,074 --> 00:57:01,643
to expand, as well.

1211
00:57:01,643 --> 00:57:04,326
- Do you feel like your
business is ready to do that?

1212
00:57:04,326 --> 00:57:05,791
- [Radul] I don't know.

1213
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,109
- Yeah, I feel like it isn't.

1214
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:09,393
- [Radul] Yeah, probably not, yeah.

1215
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:10,632
- Right.

1216
00:57:10,632 --> 00:57:13,466
(audience laughing)

1217
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,943
You see what's happening, right?

1218
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:18,390
It's the same reasoning,
like, the get, quick, fast,

1219
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:22,057
it's his question, guys,
it's the same shit.

1220
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:27,318
It's everybody, it's the same
game over and over and over.

1221
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:30,741
I get it, and even when you
have some level of success,

1222
00:57:30,741 --> 00:57:32,408
it's hard, I get it.

1223
00:57:33,538 --> 00:57:35,017
I get it.

1224
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:35,850
I live it.

1225
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,373
I have way more opportunity than you

1226
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,967
could ever wrap your head around.

1227
00:57:40,967 --> 00:57:44,560
But I stay disciplined on what I can do.

1228
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,509
Why didn't, we've been
registered to do business

1229
00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:49,201
in Singapore for three years.

1230
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:53,477
Why is VaynerMedia not
here, we weren't ready.

1231
00:57:53,477 --> 00:57:55,807
Was my brand ready, yes.

1232
00:57:55,807 --> 00:57:57,879
Would we get business, yes.

1233
00:57:57,879 --> 00:57:59,339
Would it deliver at the
level that I thought

1234
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:02,839
I needed to to create 20 year success, no.

1235
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,483
You're on to something,

1236
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:09,099
and this is what happens
to a lot of businesses,

1237
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:10,596
I look at it everyday.

1238
00:58:10,596 --> 00:58:11,977
You're on to something,

1239
00:58:11,977 --> 00:58:14,695
and now you're tasting blood in the water

1240
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:17,121
and you're getting greedy.

1241
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:18,902
Because you see it,

1242
00:58:18,902 --> 00:58:20,328
and especially if you're
hearing it from something

1243
00:58:20,328 --> 00:58:22,399
like this, and you're like,
wait a minute, this is gonna,

1244
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:25,955
you know, like, you're
compounding your confidence,

1245
00:58:25,955 --> 00:58:30,122
which is making you go wide
when you should be going deeper.

1246
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:34,363
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1247
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,466
- Hello?
- Hello.

1248
00:58:38,466 --> 00:58:41,270
- [Moshad] Hi, hi Gary, my name is Moshad,

1249
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:42,893
and like what you said,

1250
00:58:42,893 --> 00:58:45,646
80% of your content today
is more or less on YouTube,

1251
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:47,902
that's that 30% I kind of absorb,

1252
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:50,523
I actually collected this box for my mom,

1253
00:58:50,523 --> 00:58:51,774
but firstly, I wanna tell you,

1254
00:58:51,774 --> 00:58:53,301
I'm actually gonna quit my
job to do something like

1255
00:58:53,301 --> 00:58:56,339
DRock or Word of Mouth Marketing Company,

1256
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:58,362
but before I pass this on to my mom,

1257
00:58:58,362 --> 00:59:01,120
is that your new K-Swiss
shoes, that's my question.

1258
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,792
- These are my new K-Swiss shoes.

1259
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:03,859
- [Moshad] Alright, awesome,

1260
00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:05,942
awesome, awesome, thanks.

1261
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:09,016
- [Camillia] Hi, Gary, I'm Camillia.

1262
00:59:09,016 --> 00:59:11,284
- Hey, Camillia.
- My son got me onto you.

1263
00:59:11,284 --> 00:59:14,381
I didn't even know you were around.

1264
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:15,588
- Thanks a lot, Camillia.

1265
00:59:15,588 --> 00:59:16,987
(audience laughing)

1266
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,583
I'm kidding.
- Sorry about that.

1267
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:19,795
Well, I.
- Good news,

1268
00:59:19,795 --> 00:59:22,068
99% of people don't, so, go ahead.

1269
00:59:22,068 --> 00:59:23,897
- [Camillia] It's okay,
the word is getting around.

1270
00:59:23,897 --> 00:59:25,131
- They will.
- Right.

1271
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:28,574
I'm a WOMologist, and a lot
of people ask me what I do,

1272
00:59:28,574 --> 00:59:32,102
I'm actually a specialist
in word of mouth marketing.

1273
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:33,025
- Word of mouth.

1274
00:59:33,025 --> 00:59:34,927
- [Camillia] Word of mouth, offline,

1275
00:59:34,927 --> 00:59:37,111
because I'm not an online person.

1276
00:59:37,111 --> 00:59:39,981
I've never been, and, but
he's gonna get me on it

1277
00:59:39,981 --> 00:59:42,670
because of you, okay,
so, thank you for that.

1278
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,518
- Thank you.

1279
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:45,072
- [Camillia] But, what do you call it,

1280
00:59:45,072 --> 00:59:48,224
it has always been a stigma
that for many entrepreneurs

1281
00:59:48,224 --> 00:59:52,026
that word of mouth marketing
is a very weak activity,

1282
00:59:52,026 --> 00:59:55,455
and yet, a lot of, what do you call it,

1283
00:59:55,455 --> 00:59:58,557
material says that it is the most powerful

1284
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:01,557
form of marketing, and I took it on.

1285
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:05,263
For the last four years, I did research,

1286
01:00:05,263 --> 01:00:07,549
I started a business group for it,

1287
01:00:07,549 --> 01:00:11,995
and I found out why it
was the most powerful.

1288
01:00:11,995 --> 01:00:13,890
But my question to you would be

1289
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:17,512
where do you see it in the
next three to five years?

1290
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:21,068
How does, how would it
grow, how would it evolve?

1291
01:00:21,068 --> 01:00:22,997
Word of mouth marketing in the market,

1292
01:00:22,997 --> 01:00:24,709
especially for entrepreneurs.

1293
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:29,173
- So, word of mouth marketing
is what social media is.

1294
01:00:29,173 --> 01:00:31,076
- [Camillia] Right.

1295
01:00:31,076 --> 01:00:32,901
- All that social media is,

1296
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:35,593
is the plumbing and infrastructure

1297
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:38,500
that has created word of mouth marketing

1298
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,381
to hit the scale that it's always had

1299
01:00:41,381 --> 01:00:44,250
in the invisible nature
of the conversations

1300
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,457
that we have with each other in real life.

1301
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:51,734
So, even my first book that
put me on to the world,

1302
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:54,310
Crush It!, that I wrote in 2008,

1303
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,893
most of it refers to word of mouth,

1304
01:00:55,893 --> 01:00:59,112
and then the book I wrote
in 2011, Thank You Economy,

1305
01:00:59,112 --> 01:01:01,968
is basically just about
word of mouth marketing.

1306
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:03,420
It's about being extraordinary

1307
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,886
to force word of mouth marketing.

1308
01:01:05,886 --> 01:01:09,157
I believe nothing sells
product and services

1309
01:01:09,157 --> 01:01:13,155
more than another human
being to another human being.

1310
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:16,388
Where it lives, I think will continue

1311
01:01:16,388 --> 01:01:18,305
to go into this device,

1312
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:22,907
not us talking, and I think that's great.

1313
01:01:24,787 --> 01:01:29,480
I think too many people want
us to talk to each other,

1314
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,147
so I find platforms fascinating.

1315
01:01:33,308 --> 01:01:37,066
I find it fascinating that
we put a pen and paper,

1316
01:01:37,066 --> 01:01:39,382
somebody writing a letter, today,

1317
01:01:39,382 --> 01:01:42,132
as this incredibly great gesture,

1318
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:46,941
even though we do it on here all the time.

1319
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:49,761
We're putting pen and paper on a pedestal,

1320
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:54,515
not the words that we're
exchanging with each other.

1321
01:01:54,515 --> 01:01:56,699
And so, I think word of mouth marketing

1322
01:01:56,699 --> 01:02:00,866
is basically the old school
term for social media.

1323
01:02:02,981 --> 01:02:06,006
I'm a buyer, to the end of time.

1324
01:02:06,006 --> 01:02:09,430
Until the robots kill us, I'm a fan.

1325
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:10,263
(Camillia laughing)

1326
01:02:10,263 --> 01:02:11,096
- [Camillia] Thank you, Gary.

1327
01:02:11,096 --> 01:02:13,513
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

1328
01:02:15,403 --> 01:02:16,557
(Gary laughing)

1329
01:02:16,557 --> 01:02:17,557
- Nice pass.

1330
01:02:18,718 --> 01:02:20,493
How are you?
- Hi, how are you?

1331
01:02:20,493 --> 01:02:24,247
Okay, I have this question,
okay, first of all,

1332
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:27,088
I've been following you
for a few years now,

1333
01:02:27,088 --> 01:02:31,255
I think back from 2014, and
you completely changed my life,

1334
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:35,832
and how I operated my business.

1335
01:02:35,832 --> 01:02:38,049
It was really tiny back then,

1336
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:41,716
but we managed to have
really healthy growth

1337
01:02:42,982 --> 01:02:44,962
year after year, thanks to you.

1338
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:46,321
- Thank you, thanks to you.

1339
01:02:46,321 --> 01:02:48,287
- [Woman] And the question is,

1340
01:02:48,287 --> 01:02:50,120
we're at a point where

1341
01:02:51,498 --> 01:02:53,642
we're in that crossroad

1342
01:02:53,642 --> 01:02:56,168
where we have to decide where we want

1343
01:02:56,168 --> 01:02:58,418
to either grow organically,

1344
01:02:59,962 --> 01:03:04,928
or we also have the option
to grow rapidly, as well,

1345
01:03:04,928 --> 01:03:06,511
because we have interest.

1346
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:08,619
- And if you grow rapidly,
you have to take investment?

1347
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:11,066
- [Woman] Yeah, because
we have interested parties

1348
01:03:11,066 --> 01:03:14,215
wanting to offer that to us, as well, and.

1349
01:03:14,215 --> 01:03:15,799
- Do you own the business?

1350
01:03:15,799 --> 01:03:16,993
- Yes.
- 100%?

1351
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,704
- [Woman] So, that's the thing.

1352
01:03:19,704 --> 01:03:22,122
I'm, I just wanted to
hear your take in that,

1353
01:03:22,122 --> 01:03:24,176
like, if you have options to grow.

1354
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:25,877
- Do you own the business 100%?

1355
01:03:25,877 --> 01:03:26,913
- [Woman] Yes.

1356
01:03:26,913 --> 01:03:29,163
- Do you wanna have a boss?

1357
01:03:30,834 --> 01:03:34,134
- [Woman] Not, it depends,
it depends on the angle,

1358
01:03:34,134 --> 01:03:37,462
because I do have a certain
angle that I want to get to,

1359
01:03:37,462 --> 01:03:40,968
so I'm just, I just wanted
to hear your take in this of,

1360
01:03:40,968 --> 01:03:44,077
do you, how do you feel
about growing consistently,

1361
01:03:44,077 --> 01:03:48,441
organically, on your own, but
it'll take really long time,

1362
01:03:48,441 --> 01:03:50,817
and somebody else might come in

1363
01:03:50,817 --> 01:03:53,048
and take away the opportunity, and.

1364
01:03:53,048 --> 01:03:54,932
- Do you believe that?

1365
01:03:54,932 --> 01:03:56,257
- [Woman] You never know.

1366
01:03:56,257 --> 01:03:59,124
I feel like I have a
certain value to offer,

1367
01:03:59,124 --> 01:04:03,124
and there's nothing like it at this point,

1368
01:04:03,124 --> 01:04:04,953
so I feel like I have that certain value,

1369
01:04:04,953 --> 01:04:06,480
and I have that following,

1370
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,799
I have the trust and the loyal
of our customers, as well.

1371
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,409
- If you can raise capital
to speed up your process

1372
01:04:14,409 --> 01:04:18,331
and to create bigger distance
between somebody copying you,

1373
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:22,102
that's meaningful, and
you don't give up control,

1374
01:04:22,102 --> 01:04:24,779
it's a worthwhile debate.

1375
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:28,276
80% of 100 million's better
than 100% of 40 million

1376
01:04:28,276 --> 01:04:30,359
from a dollar standpoint.

1377
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,870
Just don't think that
just 'cause you sold off

1378
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,863
20% of your company doesn't mean

1379
01:04:37,863 --> 01:04:40,181
that you're not gonna be held accountable.

1380
01:04:40,181 --> 01:04:41,534
Let me give you an example.

1381
01:04:41,534 --> 01:04:45,463
When AJ and I sold a piece of
VaynerMedia to Stephen Ross,

1382
01:04:45,463 --> 01:04:47,530
one of the things that I made required

1383
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:48,951
is that I never had to have a meeting

1384
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,881
to tell them how the business was doing.

1385
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:52,521
- [Woman] Alright.

1386
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:53,641
- You like that?

1387
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:54,474
- [Audience] Yeah!

1388
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:55,849
- It's a good one, right?

1389
01:04:55,849 --> 01:04:58,394
Now, he was worth eight billion dollars,

1390
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,476
so he could give a crap ass.

1391
01:04:59,476 --> 01:05:03,151
You need to make sure,
whether you sell 1%,

1392
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:05,384
you could sell 1% of your company,

1393
01:05:05,384 --> 01:05:06,978
and that investor might take up

1394
01:05:06,978 --> 01:05:09,988
a disproportionate amount of your time.

1395
01:05:09,988 --> 01:05:12,047
The biggest issue is time

1396
01:05:12,047 --> 01:05:14,327
when you sell a piece of your company.

1397
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,901
Do you really wanna
prep for an entire week

1398
01:05:16,901 --> 01:05:19,403
every 90 days for an investor meeting

1399
01:05:19,403 --> 01:05:21,635
so you can justify your behavior?

1400
01:05:21,635 --> 01:05:23,476
- [Woman] Yeah, but the thing is,

1401
01:05:23,476 --> 01:05:27,278
I'm quite keen on taking that offer,

1402
01:05:27,278 --> 01:05:30,505
because it's much more
of a strategy partnership

1403
01:05:30,505 --> 01:05:33,160
that will bring up value to me.

1404
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,412
- So let's talk about that for a minute.

1405
01:05:34,412 --> 01:05:37,011
Is it a human or is it a company?

1406
01:05:37,011 --> 01:05:38,261
- [Woman] Both.

1407
01:05:39,478 --> 01:05:42,030
Because, it's a company, yeah.

1408
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:44,448
- Is the human that you're excited about

1409
01:05:44,448 --> 01:05:47,977
being a strategic value
prop to you an employee

1410
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,965
of the company or owns the company?

1411
01:05:49,965 --> 01:05:51,014
- [Woman] Owns the company.

1412
01:05:51,014 --> 01:05:51,977
- Okay.

1413
01:05:51,977 --> 01:05:54,455
So you feel you'll get
value from this individual?

1414
01:05:54,455 --> 01:05:55,607
- [Woman] Yeah, both sides,

1415
01:05:55,607 --> 01:05:58,310
because they wanted to
invest because they wanted

1416
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:01,714
to have us under their property as well.

1417
01:06:01,714 --> 01:06:03,248
- Sure.
- 'Cause that could bring

1418
01:06:03,248 --> 01:06:04,578
certain value to them, as well,

1419
01:06:04,578 --> 01:06:06,135
so that's why they want it, so.

1420
01:06:06,135 --> 01:06:07,067
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1421
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:08,550
- How, I mean, you know,

1422
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:10,093
as you can see, as we're digging,

1423
01:06:10,093 --> 01:06:11,918
there's no right answer to this question.

1424
01:06:11,918 --> 01:06:13,575
- [Woman] Yeah, there's
no right at all, yeah.

1425
01:06:13,575 --> 01:06:14,826
- I think the question
becomes how comfortable

1426
01:06:14,826 --> 01:06:16,166
you feel with them.

1427
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:20,646
I think you need to make sure
you over talk expectations.

1428
01:06:20,646 --> 01:06:22,846
Young entrepreneurs often make the mistake

1429
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:26,679
of only seeing the good
side of an investment.

1430
01:06:27,747 --> 01:06:29,731
And there's, nobody's giving you lots

1431
01:06:29,731 --> 01:06:33,231
of money 'cause they think you're awesome.

1432
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:36,209
And so, you just need to be thoughtful.

1433
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:38,142
The amount of people that
I've seen raise capital

1434
01:06:38,142 --> 01:06:41,390
when they didn't need to and
it destroyed their business,

1435
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:44,531
is more than I'd like to say.

1436
01:06:44,531 --> 01:06:46,822
At the same token,

1437
01:06:46,822 --> 01:06:48,907
there's a ton of people
who would have failed

1438
01:06:48,907 --> 01:06:51,687
and gone out of business
without a strategic investment,

1439
01:06:51,687 --> 01:06:53,873
and then it turned into a huge success.

1440
01:06:53,873 --> 01:06:55,517
Here's what I would say.

1441
01:06:55,517 --> 01:06:57,348
Everything that's in your stomach

1442
01:06:57,348 --> 01:06:59,621
that you wanna ask and talk about,

1443
01:06:59,621 --> 01:07:01,712
do it before you sign that contract.

1444
01:07:01,712 --> 01:07:03,774
That's the mistake.

1445
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:05,570
You sit on two or three
things that you just

1446
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,856
think will work themselves out,

1447
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:09,565
bring them to the forefront.

1448
01:07:09,565 --> 01:07:11,857
- Okay.
- Make sense?

1449
01:07:11,857 --> 01:07:13,514
- Yeah, it makes sense.
- I'm sure there's one

1450
01:07:13,514 --> 01:07:15,299
to two things that are in your head.

1451
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:16,450
- [Woman] Yeah, a few things,

1452
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,874
like you were saying
there's no right or wrong,

1453
01:07:17,874 --> 01:07:20,221
it's just, I have a certain angle

1454
01:07:20,221 --> 01:07:22,496
that I wanted to get to, and.

1455
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:25,143
- What does angle mean?

1456
01:07:25,143 --> 01:07:26,298
Dollar amount?

1457
01:07:26,298 --> 01:07:27,381
- [Woman] No, no, no.

1458
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:30,458
It's in, itself, the impact of the company

1459
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:33,857
that I wanted to, because
the kind of impact I wanted

1460
01:07:33,857 --> 01:07:37,125
to get, I wanted to have
that certain impact,

1461
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:41,159
the level that I wanted to
have it, I need a partner.

1462
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:42,699
And that's what.

1463
01:07:42,699 --> 01:07:44,567
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

1464
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:47,490
- The impact that you
want the company to have,

1465
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:51,407
could you get to that
impact 11 years from now?

1466
01:07:52,488 --> 01:07:54,097
- [Woman] Yeah.

1467
01:07:54,097 --> 01:07:56,015
- So, then you have to ask yourself,

1468
01:07:56,015 --> 01:07:59,356
are you trying to get
to the impact sooner,

1469
01:07:59,356 --> 01:08:01,345
and you're putting that as a romantic

1470
01:08:01,345 --> 01:08:03,128
point of view in your head,

1471
01:08:03,128 --> 01:08:07,090
and are you giving up too
much to get there sooner,

1472
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:10,371
because it's just one
bigger version of patience,

1473
01:08:10,371 --> 01:08:13,833
this is why I'm pounding
patience down people's throats.

1474
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:17,014
And more importantly, is this impact real,

1475
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:19,971
or is it manifested in your
head as a romantic thing,

1476
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,584
you know, you gotta
think about those things.

1477
01:08:21,585 --> 01:08:23,344
- [Woman] No, it's real,
because the thing is,

1478
01:08:23,344 --> 01:08:27,893
with our company, we're
super engaged, because,

1479
01:08:27,893 --> 01:08:31,104
customers and our followers,
they don't see us as brands,

1480
01:08:31,104 --> 01:08:33,508
they see us as a friend.

1481
01:08:33,508 --> 01:08:35,886
So, that's how we built, like.

1482
01:08:35,886 --> 01:08:38,073
- Be careful, because, at scale,

1483
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:40,304
that tends to go away.
- Yeah, I get that, yeah.

1484
01:08:40,304 --> 01:08:41,211
That's the thing,

1485
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:44,910
we have to have a
certain balance somewhat,

1486
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:46,006
yeah, as we scale.

1487
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:49,274
- That was probably the thing
that scared me the most,

1488
01:08:49,274 --> 01:08:50,107
because,

1489
01:08:51,348 --> 01:08:54,166
if that's how your consumers feel,

1490
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:58,273
it's almost impossible for
somebody investing in you

1491
01:08:58,273 --> 01:09:01,424
to being comfortable with
you doing the behavior

1492
01:09:01,424 --> 01:09:03,973
that makes that 100% pure.

1493
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,957
They are thinking about the scale of that,

1494
01:09:06,957 --> 01:09:10,711
which then dilutes the energy of that.

1495
01:09:10,712 --> 01:09:13,014
- [Woman] It's not my voice,
it's the company's voice.

1496
01:09:13,014 --> 01:09:15,856
So, they don't see the brand as a person,

1497
01:09:15,856 --> 01:09:17,246
it's just, they feel like--
- I understand.

1498
01:09:17,246 --> 01:09:18,337
- Yeah, yeah.
- I understand.

1499
01:09:18,337 --> 01:09:19,795
- [Woman] When they see the, like,

1500
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:21,638
the people that runs this
company has a certain value

1501
01:09:21,638 --> 01:09:24,064
that they resonate to, so, yeah.

1502
01:09:24,064 --> 01:09:25,854
- Let me ask one last
question, and we'll move on.

1503
01:09:25,854 --> 01:09:28,863
Does the investor have any
say after the transaction?

1504
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:30,334
- [Woman] No, not really.

1505
01:09:30,335 --> 01:09:31,555
- Good, then do it.

1506
01:09:31,555 --> 01:09:32,751
- [Woman] Yeah, alright.

1507
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:33,700
(audience laughing)

1508
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,654
- But just make sure you
define the not really part.

1509
01:09:36,654 --> 01:09:37,730
- [Woman] Yeah, because, no,

1510
01:09:37,731 --> 01:09:39,765
because they do have a certain,

1511
01:09:39,765 --> 01:09:42,750
they, based on the
conversations that we have,

1512
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,680
they do wanted to offer advice,

1513
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,682
try to bring up a certain value for us,

1514
01:09:49,683 --> 01:09:52,231
but, Gary Vee, ultimately,
it's still my decision,

1515
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,203
'cause that's what they, they told.

1516
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:55,445
- Ownership.
- Yeah.

1517
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:56,416
- Good luck.
- Thank you so much.

1518
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:57,833
- You're welcome.

1519
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,184
Did we lose it?

1520
01:10:07,184 --> 01:10:08,941
There we go.

1521
01:10:08,941 --> 01:10:09,837
- [Shawn] Hi, Gary.

1522
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:10,670
- How are you?

1523
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,367
- [Shawn] I'm good,
I'm good, and yourself?

1524
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:17,308
Okay, I'm Shawn, I'm a digital
marketer from Malaysia.

1525
01:10:17,308 --> 01:10:19,334
First off, I took your advice,

1526
01:10:19,334 --> 01:10:21,179
and I started vlogging not too long ago,

1527
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:23,701
and I'm already seeing work,

1528
01:10:23,701 --> 01:10:25,527
doors that I could never
imagine are starting

1529
01:10:25,527 --> 01:10:28,390
to open for me, and I only
have you to thank you for that.

1530
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,291
I have a two part question,

1531
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:32,826
first, my father owns a
traditional billboard business

1532
01:10:32,826 --> 01:10:35,588
with about 1,000 sites,
mostly along the highway.

1533
01:10:35,588 --> 01:10:38,368
I'm persuading him to
invest into it digitally,

1534
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:40,366
I don't work for his business yet,

1535
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:42,184
but I assume I will in the future.

1536
01:10:42,184 --> 01:10:43,624
Given your expertise,

1537
01:10:43,624 --> 01:10:45,811
if we became partners
today in this business,

1538
01:10:45,811 --> 01:10:47,438
how would you focus your resources,

1539
01:10:47,438 --> 01:10:50,174
and what would you, what
would your first steps be?

1540
01:10:50,174 --> 01:10:51,441
- What kind of business is it?

1541
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:54,113
- [Shawn] A traditional
billboard business.

1542
01:10:54,113 --> 01:10:55,775
- Traditional what?
- Billboard.

1543
01:10:55,775 --> 01:10:57,358
- Billboard.
- Yeah.

1544
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:01,387
- So, your dad owns billboards.

1545
01:11:01,387 --> 01:11:04,398
- [Shawn] Yes, 1,000
sites along the highway.

1546
01:11:04,398 --> 01:11:06,829
- Which is rad, is it, are they digital?

1547
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:07,905
- [Shawn] No.

1548
01:11:07,905 --> 01:11:09,293
It's too early.
- So,

1549
01:11:09,293 --> 01:11:11,476
I would probably make the capital invest,

1550
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:14,549
if I took over my dad's
business or became his partner,

1551
01:11:14,549 --> 01:11:17,671
I'd probably take the
capital risk up front

1552
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:19,554
to take them digital,

1553
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:22,003
'cause I think that's gonna be required

1554
01:11:22,003 --> 01:11:25,662
to get the value out of that outdoor.

1555
01:11:25,662 --> 01:11:28,245
I would also look to diversify,

1556
01:11:30,122 --> 01:11:32,890
'cause I'd be too fearful,
you're a young dude,

1557
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:35,521
I'm too fearful about self-driving cars

1558
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:36,975
and all the things that
happen over the next

1559
01:11:36,975 --> 01:11:39,787
20, 30 years that would disproportionately

1560
01:11:39,787 --> 01:11:43,620
decrease the value of
the asset that you have.

1561
01:11:44,578 --> 01:11:47,459
So, my intuition is
that I would diversify,

1562
01:11:47,459 --> 01:11:50,237
I would either sell off half the boards

1563
01:11:50,237 --> 01:11:52,781
and then put it into
building a media company,

1564
01:11:52,781 --> 01:11:55,608
or I would reinvest all
the profits each year

1565
01:11:55,608 --> 01:11:58,404
into building some sort
of digital complement

1566
01:11:58,404 --> 01:12:00,948
to a traditional product like that.

1567
01:12:00,948 --> 01:12:02,418
- [Shawn] Okay, got it.

1568
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,944
The second part to the question is

1569
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:06,205
as an extension to my vlogging,

1570
01:12:06,205 --> 01:12:08,820
I plan to start a series
of interview videos

1571
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:11,559
of podcast sessions with
people within the same field

1572
01:12:11,559 --> 01:12:13,904
to talk about what they do,

1573
01:12:13,904 --> 01:12:16,979
and I was wondering, this
is, starting my luck here,

1574
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:19,954
would be my first guest to officiate this?

1575
01:12:19,954 --> 01:12:21,993
- So, I won't, but.

1576
01:12:21,993 --> 01:12:23,558
- [Shawn] Ouch, see, that hurts.

1577
01:12:23,558 --> 01:12:27,314
- But, if you do 15
episodes, I'll be your 16th.

1578
01:12:27,314 --> 01:12:28,236
- [Shawn] Okay.

1579
01:12:28,236 --> 01:12:30,123
I already have 22.

1580
01:12:30,123 --> 01:12:31,237
- What's that?

1581
01:12:31,237 --> 01:12:33,491
- [Shawn] I started my
vlog, like, 22 episodes,

1582
01:12:33,491 --> 01:12:36,991
but I will start 15 interviews after that,

1583
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:38,990
and you'll be my 16th?

1584
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:40,443
- You've done 22 vlog episodes.

1585
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:41,307
- [Shawn] Vlogs.

1586
01:12:41,307 --> 01:12:42,609
- But if I was listening carefully,

1587
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:44,706
you asked me to be a
guest on your new podcast.

1588
01:12:44,706 --> 01:12:46,273
- [Shawn] Right, okay, got it.

1589
01:12:46,273 --> 01:12:48,624
- So, that, I'll wait 'til I'm the 16th.

1590
01:12:48,624 --> 01:12:50,021
- [Shawn] Got it, thank you very much.

1591
01:12:50,021 --> 01:12:51,438
- You're welcome.

1592
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,637
- Hello?
- Hello.

1593
01:12:57,637 --> 01:12:59,909
- [Terrance] Yeah, hi,
Gary, my name is Terrance,

1594
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:01,518
and I'm 20 this year.

1595
01:13:01,518 --> 01:13:03,445
So, just one question for you,

1596
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:06,296
I've been listening to
you for about a year now,

1597
01:13:06,296 --> 01:13:08,911
and I'm just trying to figure out,

1598
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:10,902
as a 20 year old without any experience

1599
01:13:10,902 --> 01:13:12,860
in my parents' business,

1600
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:15,943
I've wanted to build a video, a blog,

1601
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:19,881
an audio podcast, but I
don't have the experience

1602
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:21,712
to actually do it.

1603
01:13:21,712 --> 01:13:23,952
So, which answer should I focus on,

1604
01:13:23,952 --> 01:13:26,654
building up the experience in a business,

1605
01:13:26,654 --> 01:13:30,193
or should I go direct to
help market a company?

1606
01:13:30,193 --> 01:13:34,866
- Well, listen, if you started
a podcast and a video blog

1607
01:13:34,866 --> 01:13:38,709
about being experienced in the craft,

1608
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:40,653
that would be bad,

1609
01:13:40,653 --> 01:13:41,486
faking it.

1610
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:45,108
But if your podcast was about

1611
01:13:45,108 --> 01:13:48,772
the experience of learning the craft,

1612
01:13:48,772 --> 01:13:52,978
you'd probably have a lot of
20 year olds following you.

1613
01:13:52,978 --> 01:13:56,656
So, I don't think it's about
getting the experience,

1614
01:13:56,656 --> 01:13:59,104
when I talk about I built
a business for 15 years

1615
01:13:59,104 --> 01:14:01,868
before I came out, right?

1616
01:14:01,868 --> 01:14:05,622
I say that because that's what happened,

1617
01:14:05,622 --> 01:14:07,452
but I have a funny feeling
if the internet was around

1618
01:14:07,452 --> 01:14:09,276
when I was a kid, like this,

1619
01:14:09,276 --> 01:14:12,648
I might have started documenting
my journey right away.

1620
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,669
I just wouldn't be walking around

1621
01:14:14,669 --> 01:14:17,648
like I was a business building guy,

1622
01:14:17,648 --> 01:14:19,479
I would be talking about being a young,

1623
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:23,321
ambitious guy who used
to sell baseball cards

1624
01:14:23,321 --> 01:14:25,681
and now I'm about to do it for wine,

1625
01:14:25,681 --> 01:14:27,928
and I would take people
along with my journey,

1626
01:14:27,928 --> 01:14:29,911
that's my biggest problem with people

1627
01:14:29,911 --> 01:14:33,314
that don't have experience, they're lying.

1628
01:14:33,314 --> 01:14:35,198
They're lying that
they're business experts,

1629
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:39,198
or my favorite, you're a
20 year old life coach.

1630
01:14:40,129 --> 01:14:43,008
'Cause, you know, you've lived life.

1631
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:46,318
So, to me, I think you
can start the podcast

1632
01:14:46,318 --> 01:14:50,137
and the video blog, I
mean, I wish I did that,

1633
01:14:50,137 --> 01:14:53,970
because I, there was, I
probably cried, cried,

1634
01:14:55,494 --> 01:14:59,874
50 times in the first 10 years
that I worked with my dad,

1635
01:14:59,874 --> 01:15:02,592
'cause they were very painful fights.

1636
01:15:02,592 --> 01:15:04,504
And that would have
been incredible content

1637
01:15:04,504 --> 01:15:06,126
that I wish you guys could watch

1638
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:09,348
if you're in a family business,
because it turned out okay,

1639
01:15:09,348 --> 01:15:10,670
and it would have been really cool

1640
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,942
to see how that happened and why,

1641
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:16,268
and how I was able to
give more than I took,

1642
01:15:16,268 --> 01:15:18,494
and how I loved my dad
more than the money,

1643
01:15:18,494 --> 01:15:20,705
and how I thought about what I could do

1644
01:15:20,705 --> 01:15:24,894
in my 30s and 40s and it's
okay to lose in my 20s,

1645
01:15:24,894 --> 01:15:26,675
but I wouldn't have walked around and said

1646
01:15:26,675 --> 01:15:30,842
I was a marketing genius because
I thought I was gonna be.

1647
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:34,967
- [Terrance] Yeah.

1648
01:15:34,967 --> 01:15:39,717
So, start documenting my journey
to becoming a businessman?

1649
01:15:39,717 --> 01:15:40,717
- Hell yeah.

1650
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:42,754
- [Terrance] Got it.

1651
01:15:42,754 --> 01:15:44,642
- If you think that's interesting.

1652
01:15:44,642 --> 01:15:47,355
Maybe you're not comfortable
enough in your own skin

1653
01:15:47,355 --> 01:15:49,464
to talk about all the failures,

1654
01:15:49,464 --> 01:15:51,235
which is the most interesting part

1655
01:15:51,235 --> 01:15:55,415
of documenting being a
20 year old businessman.

1656
01:15:55,415 --> 01:15:56,665
But if you are,

1657
01:15:57,562 --> 01:16:00,281
there's some people that are gonna listen.

1658
01:16:00,281 --> 01:16:03,188
The truth always wins, my friend.

1659
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:04,754
That's all you need to know.

1660
01:16:04,754 --> 01:16:06,675
- [Terrance] Alright.

1661
01:16:06,675 --> 01:16:07,772
Can I get a hug?

1662
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,938
- A hug?
- Yeah.

1663
01:16:08,938 --> 01:16:09,771
- Sure!

1664
01:16:09,771 --> 01:16:10,858
- [Terrance] Awesome!

1665
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:13,858
(everyone cheering)

1666
01:16:20,236 --> 01:16:21,870
- [Gary] Are we gonna
take a picture of the hug?

1667
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,870
(audience laughing)

1668
01:16:30,151 --> 01:16:31,831
- Let's start a vlog now, okay.

1669
01:16:31,831 --> 01:16:33,827
So, my journey to becoming a businessman.

1670
01:16:33,827 --> 01:16:35,298
- He's liar, he said
he was gonna do a hug,

1671
01:16:35,298 --> 01:16:36,487
and now he's doing a vlog.
- Okay, okay,

1672
01:16:36,487 --> 01:16:37,320
I'm sorry!

1673
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,667
(audience laughing)

1674
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:40,994
Thank you so much, Gary.

1675
01:16:40,994 --> 01:16:43,198
- You're welcome, you're welcome.

1676
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:44,869
Alright, after this question,
let's send it over there,

1677
01:16:44,869 --> 01:16:48,015
'cause they're about to start a coup.

1678
01:16:48,015 --> 01:16:48,848
Go ahead.

1679
01:16:50,283 --> 01:16:52,283
- [Man] Thank you, Gary,

1680
01:16:53,852 --> 01:16:57,254
I flew in from Malaysia to see you.

1681
01:16:57,254 --> 01:16:58,359
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1682
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:01,353
So, okay, I am a little
bit of confused right now

1683
01:17:01,353 --> 01:17:05,026
in our business, because,
we're in the hosting business.

1684
01:17:05,026 --> 01:17:06,606
- Hosting?
- Yes.

1685
01:17:06,606 --> 01:17:07,468
- Hosting websites.

1686
01:17:07,468 --> 01:17:09,410
- Not only websites.
- Right.

1687
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:10,586
- But several hosting.
- Understood.

1688
01:17:10,586 --> 01:17:13,294
- [Man] Kind of services.

1689
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:16,504
So, when we are saying,
because Google, Amazon,

1690
01:17:16,504 --> 01:17:18,840
IBM, all the big giant out there,

1691
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,700
and when you're saying marketing budget,

1692
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,521
we can't compete.

1693
01:17:23,521 --> 01:17:24,695
- No way.
- And if

1694
01:17:24,695 --> 01:17:28,015
we can't afford the content,
the blogs, the video,

1695
01:17:28,015 --> 01:17:30,702
they are everywhere, so,

1696
01:17:30,702 --> 01:17:33,216
do you have any advice for this?

1697
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:35,322
- Well, who, who's using you now?

1698
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:37,180
- [Man] Okay.

1699
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,153
What we are doing is--
- How many customers

1700
01:17:39,153 --> 01:17:40,381
do you have?

1701
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:41,758
- [Man] Okay, about 500.

1702
01:17:41,758 --> 01:17:43,972
- Okay, great, so we have
a great situation here.

1703
01:17:43,972 --> 01:17:46,466
The first thing that, if
I was your new partner,

1704
01:17:46,466 --> 01:17:49,519
and I was brought in to do
the marketing as the partner,

1705
01:17:49,519 --> 01:17:51,548
the first thing I would
do is figure out why

1706
01:17:51,548 --> 01:17:54,218
those 500 people are using us,

1707
01:17:54,218 --> 01:17:57,484
and then that would be the
content that I would distribute.

1708
01:17:57,484 --> 01:18:01,651
Don't ever mistake money
as a competitive advantage.

1709
01:18:02,858 --> 01:18:05,063
Because plenty of big
companies throw money

1710
01:18:05,063 --> 01:18:06,896
directly in the trash.

1711
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:12,034
So, there's a reason 500
people are using you.

1712
01:18:12,034 --> 01:18:14,489
Now, it may be that you're very good at DR

1713
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:16,653
and intent based marketing
and you're winning on

1714
01:18:16,653 --> 01:18:18,840
Google AdWords, I don't know,

1715
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,277
then, after I figure out
why you have 500 customers,

1716
01:18:22,277 --> 01:18:23,656
then I would ask you the next question,

1717
01:18:23,656 --> 01:18:26,083
which is, how long have
you been in business?

1718
01:18:26,083 --> 01:18:27,704
- [Man] About five years.

1719
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:29,553
- Great, and how many
customers do you have

1720
01:18:29,553 --> 01:18:32,870
that have been with you
for three years or more?

1721
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:34,627
- [Man] I do not have the exact numbers,

1722
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,016
but I guess it's somewhere about 50.

1723
01:18:37,016 --> 01:18:39,996
- Great, then I would survey them.

1724
01:18:39,996 --> 01:18:42,673
And listen, they may stay
with you because it's passive,

1725
01:18:42,673 --> 01:18:45,401
once you're on a server,
you don't wanna mess it,

1726
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:47,323
but I would look for the insight.

1727
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:51,704
Is it the homegrown, you
know, high touch, small,

1728
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:54,605
I don't know, but once
I understood why people

1729
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:57,750
were coming to us and staying with us,

1730
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:01,907
I would make all my
communication around that.

1731
01:19:01,907 --> 01:19:04,778
I'm never worried about
who's got more money.

1732
01:19:04,778 --> 01:19:06,509
When I had a liquor store
doing three million dollars

1733
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:10,676
a year, 10% gross profit,
300,000 before expenses,

1734
01:19:11,796 --> 01:19:15,463
my marketing budget in
year one was $14,000.

1735
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:17,433
For the year.

1736
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:21,065
And https://www.wine.com,
the first version,

1737
01:19:21,065 --> 01:19:22,732
raised $130 million.

1738
01:19:24,271 --> 01:19:27,689
The amount of days that
I spent worry about them

1739
01:19:27,689 --> 01:19:28,522
was this.

1740
01:19:31,937 --> 01:19:32,937
Fuck Google.

1741
01:19:33,922 --> 01:19:35,097
- [Man] (laughing) Okay.

1742
01:19:35,097 --> 01:19:37,472
So, essentially what you're saying is when

1743
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:39,875
I'm going to look into the insights,

1744
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:43,023
and the next step, still
content marketing, is it?

1745
01:19:43,023 --> 01:19:45,992
- Content always, so, are
you doing conversion based,

1746
01:19:45,992 --> 01:19:48,903
like, is that how you're
getting your customers?

1747
01:19:48,903 --> 01:19:53,897
- [Man] Okay, we are just
ranked organically on Google,

1748
01:19:53,897 --> 01:19:56,734
and recently, we started blogging.

1749
01:19:56,734 --> 01:20:00,279
So, that's what we are really doing,

1750
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:03,518
is a little bit of Google
AdWords and Facebook marketing,

1751
01:20:03,518 --> 01:20:06,479
but they don't really work so well for us.

1752
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:08,588
- Have you done Facebook ads against

1753
01:20:08,588 --> 01:20:12,338
employees of companies
that you wanna get on?

1754
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:15,319
- [Man] Sorry, I don't get that meaning.

1755
01:20:15,319 --> 01:20:18,857
- When you run a Facebook
ad, you have to target it.

1756
01:20:18,857 --> 01:20:21,260
It's not putting a piece of
content and hitting boost,

1757
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,078
that's 17 years ago.

1758
01:20:23,078 --> 01:20:25,752
It's making a piece of
content and targeting

1759
01:20:25,752 --> 01:20:27,818
who you wanna reach.

1760
01:20:27,818 --> 01:20:30,299
Do you do the marketing?

1761
01:20:30,299 --> 01:20:31,853
- [Man] Yes, I'm the one who,

1762
01:20:31,853 --> 01:20:33,108
doing it, yeah.
- Good.

1763
01:20:33,108 --> 01:20:34,552
So, when you've done Facebook,

1764
01:20:34,552 --> 01:20:35,850
you said it doesn't work for you.

1765
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:40,017
When you post it, are you
running ads against the content?

1766
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:44,554
- [Man] No, we do it
directly to the landing page.

1767
01:20:44,554 --> 01:20:46,973
- I understand, but when
you post it in Facebook,

1768
01:20:46,973 --> 01:20:48,454
are you just posting it organically

1769
01:20:48,454 --> 01:20:49,870
to the 30 fans you have?

1770
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:51,734
- [Man] No, we run ads, certainly.

1771
01:20:51,734 --> 01:20:53,931
- Good, who are you targeting?

1772
01:20:53,931 --> 01:20:56,823
- [Man] Okay, we figure
out who are our customers,

1773
01:20:56,823 --> 01:21:00,990
so, okay, one of the major
customer is the Forex Trader.

1774
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:04,380
- Is the what?
- Forex Trader.

1775
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,150
- Okay.
- Because they run robots.

1776
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:08,227
Okay, they use our service, so,

1777
01:21:08,227 --> 01:21:11,894
we target exactly what
that ad interest are,

1778
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:16,624
the Forex signal, the MetaTrader
4, those kind of thing,

1779
01:21:16,624 --> 01:21:17,500
but they--
- Have you,

1780
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,933
have you,

1781
01:21:18,933 --> 01:21:21,146
have you done influencer
marketing on Instagram

1782
01:21:21,146 --> 01:21:23,118
since so many of those Forex people

1783
01:21:23,118 --> 01:21:25,329
wanna build personal brands?

1784
01:21:25,329 --> 01:21:28,796
- [Man] That's the next
step I'm going to do,

1785
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:30,322
after listening what.

1786
01:21:30,322 --> 01:21:32,917
- You should definitely
pay all these characters

1787
01:21:32,917 --> 01:21:35,645
that think they're building
a personal brand in Forex,

1788
01:21:35,645 --> 01:21:39,684
and I would do sponsorships
with them as human beings.

1789
01:21:39,684 --> 01:21:41,077
It's gonna work.

1790
01:21:41,077 --> 01:21:42,160
- [Man] Okay.

1791
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,313
- Good.

1792
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:45,250
- Alright, thank you.
- You got it.

1793
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,437
(audience applauding)

1794
01:21:46,437 --> 01:21:50,104
Pass it over there,
okay, this guy stole it.

1795
01:21:52,015 --> 01:21:53,515
He broke the rule.

1796
01:21:54,504 --> 01:21:58,151
- [Yurt] I, I've actually
tried to contact DRock

1797
01:21:58,151 --> 01:21:59,443
and the whole thing, Gary Vee,

1798
01:21:59,443 --> 01:22:01,768
and of course I know that you're coming,

1799
01:22:01,768 --> 01:22:04,196
but I volunteered to
actually be the personal

1800
01:22:04,196 --> 01:22:07,449
Uber and tour guide to
tour you around Singapore,

1801
01:22:07,449 --> 01:22:10,511
but I didn't get a reply,
similarly to audience before.

1802
01:22:10,511 --> 01:22:12,915
- DRock's a really bad guy.

1803
01:22:12,915 --> 01:22:14,620
- [Yurt] But Ben actually replied to me,

1804
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:18,096
but he said no, but it's okay,
but I still rented a car,

1805
01:22:18,096 --> 01:22:20,135
and I'm with the rented car today.

1806
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,160
So, I have a few questions.

1807
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:26,423
So, I'm actually a content
creator, my name's Yurt, so,

1808
01:22:26,423 --> 01:22:29,871
I've met many businesses,
especially in the FM BIM industry,

1809
01:22:29,871 --> 01:22:33,620
that still don't understand
the importance of social media.

1810
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:36,370
I know it's a simple no
brainer to many people here,

1811
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:39,600
but, can I ask you,
what will you tell them,

1812
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,149
in a one minute kind of pitch to tell them

1813
01:22:42,149 --> 01:22:43,472
the importance of--
- Let me give you

1814
01:22:43,472 --> 01:22:44,434
a good piece of advice.

1815
01:22:44,434 --> 01:22:45,872
- [Yurt] Thank you.

1816
01:22:45,872 --> 01:22:48,205
- Never sell the unsellable.

1817
01:22:50,855 --> 01:22:52,707
I would tell them that it works better

1818
01:22:52,707 --> 01:22:54,868
than anything in the world,

1819
01:22:54,868 --> 01:22:57,888
and then if that took more
than a couple of minutes,

1820
01:22:57,888 --> 01:23:01,021
I would go knock on the next door.

1821
01:23:01,021 --> 01:23:04,759
The biggest problem is, guys
and gals like you and I,

1822
01:23:04,759 --> 01:23:08,457
we get caught up in trying
to convince somebody.

1823
01:23:08,457 --> 01:23:09,822
I've never spent a minute trying

1824
01:23:09,822 --> 01:23:12,572
to convince somebody of anything.

1825
01:23:14,195 --> 01:23:15,974
We're in a place where
a lot of people still

1826
01:23:15,974 --> 01:23:18,368
don't know that this works,

1827
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:21,745
or they ran one Facebook
ad and it didn't work,

1828
01:23:21,745 --> 01:23:25,667
and now they've decided
Facebook doesn't work.

1829
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,417
My answer is I don't.

1830
01:23:28,415 --> 01:23:30,370
I don't try to convince people.

1831
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:32,045
I tell them it works,

1832
01:23:32,045 --> 01:23:33,681
I tell them millions of businesses have

1833
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:35,826
made it work for them,

1834
01:23:35,826 --> 01:23:38,457
and then I hope that they're
interested in, if you,

1835
01:23:38,457 --> 01:23:40,846
are you trying to get people as clients?

1836
01:23:40,846 --> 01:23:42,021
- Yep.
- Good.

1837
01:23:42,021 --> 01:23:44,286
There's unlimited clients.

1838
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:45,273
- [Yurt] Got it.

1839
01:23:45,273 --> 01:23:47,350
- So, what too many
people do is they dwell,

1840
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,836
and they try to convince nine clients,

1841
01:23:49,836 --> 01:23:51,618
and that would have taken up the time

1842
01:23:51,618 --> 01:23:54,098
for them to ask for 500
other people if they were

1843
01:23:54,098 --> 01:23:56,263
interested, and they would
have landed four clients

1844
01:23:56,263 --> 01:23:58,606
while they're waiting to get nine of them

1845
01:23:58,606 --> 01:24:01,334
to still debate with them
on their fourth meeting,

1846
01:24:01,334 --> 01:24:03,602
trying to convince them.

1847
01:24:03,602 --> 01:24:04,519
Got it?
- Got it.

1848
01:24:04,519 --> 01:24:06,042
And can I have one more request,

1849
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:08,203
I actually bought one of your
Jab, Jab, Jab, Right-Hook,

1850
01:24:08,203 --> 01:24:10,230
can I get a signature from you right now?

1851
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:12,389
- You can if you pass
it over to that section.

1852
01:24:12,389 --> 01:24:14,427
(audience laughing)

1853
01:24:14,427 --> 01:24:16,800
Anybody in that section.

1854
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,111
- [Yurt] Pass it to them and come forward?

1855
01:24:18,111 --> 01:24:19,778
- Correct.
- Awesome.

1856
01:24:23,483 --> 01:24:24,316
- Hello.

1857
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:27,765
Go ahead, it'll start working.

1858
01:24:27,765 --> 01:24:29,353
Go ahead.

1859
01:24:29,353 --> 01:24:32,119
- [Woman] Yeah, I have a
professional service firm.

1860
01:24:32,119 --> 01:24:34,051
I'm doing B2B market research,

1861
01:24:34,051 --> 01:24:36,764
I started interest in
researching in TALON,

1862
01:24:36,764 --> 01:24:40,181
and then I expand into Indonesia in 2015.

1863
01:24:41,318 --> 01:24:43,080
- Hold on one second, go ahead.

1864
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,214
- [Woman] And now it's time for me

1865
01:24:44,214 --> 01:24:47,093
to expand my business again.

1866
01:24:47,093 --> 01:24:49,218
But because I'm in the
professional services,

1867
01:24:49,218 --> 01:24:50,957
when I have to expand my business,

1868
01:24:50,957 --> 01:24:53,260
I also have to add accounts.

1869
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:57,412
And I actually prioritized
two options for me right now.

1870
01:24:57,412 --> 01:25:00,923
The first option for me
is to expand into Vietnam,

1871
01:25:00,923 --> 01:25:03,256
and the second option is to,

1872
01:25:04,926 --> 01:25:06,237
you are pay, okay,

1873
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:09,987
the second option is to
start a tech startup.

1874
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:12,014
- What?

1875
01:25:12,014 --> 01:25:13,524
- [Woman] A tech startup.

1876
01:25:13,524 --> 01:25:15,352
- Why is that your second option?

1877
01:25:15,352 --> 01:25:18,025
- [Woman] Because I think
it's a big opportunity,

1878
01:25:18,025 --> 01:25:21,420
and it's the area that
many clients are focused,

1879
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:25,849
it's the pinpoint, and nobody
has actually looked into that.

1880
01:25:25,849 --> 01:25:27,731
- Okay, if you start the tech company,

1881
01:25:27,731 --> 01:25:30,198
are you gonna bring in a tech co-founder?

1882
01:25:30,198 --> 01:25:31,086
- [Woman] Yes.

1883
01:25:31,086 --> 01:25:32,814
- And give them 50% of the business?

1884
01:25:32,814 --> 01:25:33,923
- [Woman] No.

1885
01:25:33,923 --> 01:25:36,759
- Okay, so let me tell you
the most fascinating thing

1886
01:25:36,759 --> 01:25:39,265
when people decide to go from something

1887
01:25:39,265 --> 01:25:41,293
linear to a tech company.

1888
01:25:41,293 --> 01:25:44,101
They wanna do a tech company,

1889
01:25:44,101 --> 01:25:47,744
and usually they hire
somebody to build the tech,

1890
01:25:47,744 --> 01:25:50,265
'cause they don't wanna
give up any of the equity.

1891
01:25:50,265 --> 01:25:53,674
This is the number one mistake
that entrepreneurs make

1892
01:25:53,674 --> 01:25:55,622
when they go into the tech business.

1893
01:25:55,622 --> 01:25:58,411
They hire a firm because they
don't wanna give up equity,

1894
01:25:58,411 --> 01:26:01,914
but when you're in the tech business,

1895
01:26:01,914 --> 01:26:04,574
you're in the tech business,

1896
01:26:04,574 --> 01:26:07,009
and you better have a real tech partner,

1897
01:26:07,009 --> 01:26:10,533
and unless your tech
partner has minimumly 20%,

1898
01:26:10,533 --> 01:26:14,105
up to 50%, they're not gonna care enough,

1899
01:26:14,105 --> 01:26:15,744
and you also have to understand that they

1900
01:26:15,744 --> 01:26:17,903
have disproportionate leverage,

1901
01:26:17,903 --> 01:26:22,070
because they're the tech
co-founder in a tech company.

1902
01:26:23,035 --> 01:26:24,397
- [Woman] You mean if I have to give them

1903
01:26:24,397 --> 01:26:27,478
half of the shares to make it work?

1904
01:26:27,478 --> 01:26:30,259
- I would tell you that you don't have to,

1905
01:26:30,259 --> 01:26:33,426
but I have seen an unbelievable amount

1906
01:26:34,506 --> 01:26:37,506
call it, now, maybe 5,000 businesses

1907
01:26:39,539 --> 01:26:43,713
in the last 10 years that
have gone from I do this,

1908
01:26:43,713 --> 01:26:45,485
but now I'm gonna do this tech product,

1909
01:26:45,485 --> 01:26:47,832
'cause I see the pain in my business,

1910
01:26:47,832 --> 01:26:50,355
I'm gonna hire this little
firm to build my app

1911
01:26:50,355 --> 01:26:53,920
or product, or I'm gonna have a CTO,

1912
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,956
but I'm gonna pay her or him

1913
01:26:55,956 --> 01:26:57,953
and I'm not gonna give them equity,

1914
01:26:57,953 --> 01:26:59,941
and what most people
don't understand when they

1915
01:26:59,941 --> 01:27:02,504
go into the tech business
and build a tech product,

1916
01:27:02,504 --> 01:27:05,772
they're at the mercy of the tech.

1917
01:27:05,772 --> 01:27:07,689
Tech is great on paper.

1918
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:12,084
It's a very different business
when you're actually in it.

1919
01:27:12,084 --> 01:27:13,343
So I just wanna make sure,

1920
01:27:13,343 --> 01:27:15,043
and the reason I'm going down this path,

1921
01:27:15,043 --> 01:27:17,114
is I wanna make sure that you realize

1922
01:27:17,114 --> 01:27:19,589
that if you're going in the tech business,

1923
01:27:19,589 --> 01:27:22,802
you're gonna lose the leverage.

1924
01:27:22,802 --> 01:27:24,969
Unless you're a developer.

1925
01:27:26,697 --> 01:27:28,427
Does that make sense?

1926
01:27:28,427 --> 01:27:30,228
- [Woman] So, as a
professional service company,

1927
01:27:30,228 --> 01:27:33,726
is there any other option
to scale the business?

1928
01:27:33,726 --> 01:27:37,138
- Yeah, so, I think if you're
gonna build a tech platform,

1929
01:27:37,138 --> 01:27:39,441
that's a great way to scale the business,

1930
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:42,874
I just wanna make sure you're
going in eyes wide open,

1931
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:46,079
that you're going into a
totally different business.

1932
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,937
Building a tech platform
in any professional service

1933
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:52,773
is completely different than being

1934
01:27:52,773 --> 01:27:55,134
in the professional service business.

1935
01:27:55,134 --> 01:27:58,271
Right, having an agency
that builds websites

1936
01:27:58,271 --> 01:28:02,438
for clients is very different
than starting WordPress.

1937
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,790
So, I'm cool with it,

1938
01:28:08,223 --> 01:28:11,174
as long as you really know
what you're going into,

1939
01:28:11,174 --> 01:28:14,239
and I've just seen too many
people lose their first business

1940
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,829
by trying to build a scalable business,

1941
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:19,652
when they have no idea what
they're actually going into.

1942
01:28:19,652 --> 01:28:21,237
And I'm just trying to
make sure you wrapped

1943
01:28:21,237 --> 01:28:24,432
your head around, I'm
now in the tech business,

1944
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:27,092
servicing the professional
service industry

1945
01:28:27,092 --> 01:28:30,004
that I know well, which
means that you do not

1946
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:32,264
have the leverage anymore,

1947
01:28:32,264 --> 01:28:35,074
the architect and executor of the tech

1948
01:28:35,074 --> 01:28:37,363
does, 'cause what if they
build something for a year

1949
01:28:37,363 --> 01:28:39,521
or two and then they leave?

1950
01:28:39,521 --> 01:28:43,491
Like, it's very important you get there.

1951
01:28:43,491 --> 01:28:46,660
Or, you go into another market, right?

1952
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,835
Which is more of what you know,

1953
01:28:48,835 --> 01:28:51,066
other than you have to
contextualize the market

1954
01:28:51,066 --> 01:28:52,953
that you're now in.

1955
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:56,741
Both are viable, just don't
be naive about the first one,

1956
01:28:56,741 --> 01:28:58,741
because most people are.

1957
01:28:59,838 --> 01:29:02,007
- [Woman] Yeah, but it had
been something in my mind

1958
01:29:02,007 --> 01:29:05,419
for so long time, I wanted
to do it so many times,

1959
01:29:05,419 --> 01:29:08,083
and I actually went to a master degree in

1960
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:11,280
big data analytics to learn how to code,

1961
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,855
so that I could start it.
- That helps.

1962
01:29:13,855 --> 01:29:16,391
- [Woman] It helps, it's
actually give me a very good

1963
01:29:16,391 --> 01:29:18,897
connection the right
tech guys that I should.

1964
01:29:18,897 --> 01:29:19,763
- [Gary] I love that.

1965
01:29:19,763 --> 01:29:21,416
- [Woman] I should partner with them.

1966
01:29:21,416 --> 01:29:22,914
- [Gary] Okay, so let's
go back to the open,

1967
01:29:22,914 --> 01:29:24,956
now that I have that data,

1968
01:29:24,956 --> 01:29:27,131
you're debating between
expansion to a new market

1969
01:29:27,131 --> 01:29:28,628
or building the product?

1970
01:29:28,628 --> 01:29:29,824
- [Woman] Right.

1971
01:29:29,824 --> 01:29:31,998
- [Gary] And it seems like if
you don't build the product,

1972
01:29:31,998 --> 01:29:33,538
you'll always regret it?

1973
01:29:33,538 --> 01:29:34,539
- [Woman] Yes.

1974
01:29:34,539 --> 01:29:36,936
- [Gary] So, let me give
you a good piece of advice.

1975
01:29:36,936 --> 01:29:40,436
I'd rather you be broke than be regretful.

1976
01:29:43,013 --> 01:29:44,554
- [Woman] I don't want to regret.

1977
01:29:44,554 --> 01:29:45,964
I just wanna do it.

1978
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:47,303
It's like, no matter what, no lie,

1979
01:29:47,303 --> 01:29:51,348
my choice already go to,
like, building a tech product,

1980
01:29:51,348 --> 01:29:53,188
I already make decision,

1981
01:29:53,188 --> 01:29:55,693
I just wanted to hear what other

1982
01:29:55,693 --> 01:29:57,524
people would think about, because.

1983
01:29:57,524 --> 01:29:58,911
- [Gary] Why?

1984
01:29:58,911 --> 01:30:00,044
- [Woman] Because, it's like.

1985
01:30:00,044 --> 01:30:01,596
- [Gary] Who gives a
shit about my opinion?

1986
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:03,196
You've already made the decision.

1987
01:30:03,196 --> 01:30:04,837
- [Woman] Yeah, but at
least you can give me

1988
01:30:04,837 --> 01:30:07,128
a good perspective on which
I should be careful about.

1989
01:30:07,128 --> 01:30:08,337
- [Gary] I'll give you a good perspective,

1990
01:30:08,337 --> 01:30:12,311
I 100% believe in
building the tech product.

1991
01:30:12,311 --> 01:30:13,291
- [Woman] Okay, you just
confirmed my decision,

1992
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,342
thank you so much.

1993
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:17,342
(audience laughing)

1994
01:30:22,401 --> 01:30:25,473
- [Woman] First things first,
thank you very much, Gary Vee.

1995
01:30:25,473 --> 01:30:27,398
You really, really changed my life.

1996
01:30:27,398 --> 01:30:29,831
The first time I actually saw your video

1997
01:30:29,831 --> 01:30:32,280
was the 5 Minute Plea To Do.

1998
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,612
Prior to that, I've been giving myself

1999
01:30:34,612 --> 01:30:38,283
a lot of excuses for failing
and for not taking action

2000
01:30:38,283 --> 01:30:41,162
and for procrastinating,
but after I saw that video,

2001
01:30:41,162 --> 01:30:45,329
I went 100%, 200% into
just focusing on doing.

2002
01:30:46,749 --> 01:30:50,147
Now, my question is, as a
freelance digital marketer,

2003
01:30:50,147 --> 01:30:53,715
I face this challenge of
getting a lot of information,

2004
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:56,179
and having to keep myself up to date on

2005
01:30:56,179 --> 01:30:59,345
what's happening on each and
every one of the platform

2006
01:30:59,345 --> 01:31:00,843
in order to deliver a lot of value

2007
01:31:00,843 --> 01:31:02,557
to my customers, and so on.

2008
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:03,925
So, how do you actually do that,

2009
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:08,358
how do you stay on top of
things, and yet, deliver value?

2010
01:31:08,358 --> 01:31:09,695
- By working a lot.

2011
01:31:09,695 --> 01:31:11,683
(audience laughing)

2012
01:31:11,683 --> 01:31:12,881
- [Woman] So, how do you manage that,

2013
01:31:12,881 --> 01:31:15,528
within 24 hours a day, how
do you split your time,

2014
01:31:15,528 --> 01:31:17,587
do you organize, do you
systemize, what do you do?

2015
01:31:17,587 --> 01:31:19,603
- I'm definitely not organized.

2016
01:31:19,603 --> 01:31:24,053
I, this is the biggest reason
I built my personal brand,

2017
01:31:24,053 --> 01:31:27,652
the number one reason, to
stay being a practitioner.

2018
01:31:27,652 --> 01:31:31,009
I don't have the luxury
of reading a headline

2019
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:33,581
about Instagram Stories
or Snapchat filters

2020
01:31:33,581 --> 01:31:36,243
or Facebook Live without using it,

2021
01:31:36,243 --> 01:31:38,625
because I have too much
to gain on that side,

2022
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:40,999
so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, right?

2023
01:31:40,999 --> 01:31:43,068
I built my brand by being a practitioner,

2024
01:31:43,068 --> 01:31:44,657
which makes me a better strategist,

2025
01:31:44,657 --> 01:31:46,241
which makes VaynerMedia better,

2026
01:31:46,241 --> 01:31:48,513
and it just keeps feeding each other.

2027
01:31:48,513 --> 01:31:51,736
So, A, have you started
building your own profile,

2028
01:31:51,736 --> 01:31:53,581
are you interested in that, or no?

2029
01:31:53,581 --> 01:31:55,468
- [Woman] Yes, I am.

2030
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:56,821
- That would be my biggest advice.

2031
01:31:56,821 --> 01:31:58,260
Every time you see something new,

2032
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,296
make sure you build a
profile on everything,

2033
01:32:00,296 --> 01:32:02,392
and then every time
you hear a new feature,

2034
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:05,141
use it immediately, which
will then systematically

2035
01:32:05,141 --> 01:32:08,541
make you a very good strategist.

2036
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:10,469
You know, and then the other
thing I would tell you,

2037
01:32:10,469 --> 01:32:12,417
is don't beat yourself up.

2038
01:32:12,417 --> 01:32:14,951
You need time for your family,
you need vacation time,

2039
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:16,745
you don't have to hustle like Gary Vee,

2040
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:18,556
don't beat yourself up.

2041
01:32:18,556 --> 01:32:19,585
Do the best you can.

2042
01:32:19,585 --> 01:32:21,898
I don't know everything about everything.

2043
01:32:21,898 --> 01:32:23,411
I probably know a lot more about a lot

2044
01:32:23,411 --> 01:32:25,251
of this stuff than most people,

2045
01:32:25,251 --> 01:32:28,411
but you don't have to be
everything to everything,

2046
01:32:28,411 --> 01:32:31,420
you just have to be
better than the next girl.

2047
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:32,945
Do you know what I mean?

2048
01:32:32,945 --> 01:32:34,584
What people make a huge mistake about

2049
01:32:34,584 --> 01:32:38,819
is they create a fake
standard in their head.

2050
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:40,371
The way to win in business

2051
01:32:40,371 --> 01:32:43,278
is the same way to win in sports.

2052
01:32:43,278 --> 01:32:46,906
You just have to be a little
bit faster than the other guy.

2053
01:32:46,906 --> 01:32:51,731
Right, I don't have to be
100% on 100% on everything,

2054
01:32:51,731 --> 01:32:54,163
I just have to be a better alternative

2055
01:32:54,163 --> 01:32:57,703
for the same money than somebody else.

2056
01:32:57,703 --> 01:32:59,176
So, I would tell you to be very,

2057
01:32:59,176 --> 01:33:00,857
and then you gotta think about how much

2058
01:33:00,857 --> 01:33:03,507
deal flow you have, how satisfied you are,

2059
01:33:03,507 --> 01:33:06,532
I think the biggest thing is
that people beat themselves up,

2060
01:33:06,532 --> 01:33:08,806
they hold themselves
to some fake standard,

2061
01:33:08,806 --> 01:33:13,773
just make sure you're being
reasonable with yourself.

2062
01:33:13,773 --> 01:33:14,764
- [Woman] Alright, thank you.

2063
01:33:14,764 --> 01:33:16,264
- You're welcome.

2064
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:22,760
- [Man] How's this, sir?

2065
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,691
Gary, how's it going?

2066
01:33:23,691 --> 01:33:24,601
- Super well.

2067
01:33:24,601 --> 01:33:26,384
- [Man] Awesome, thank you for being here.

2068
01:33:26,384 --> 01:33:28,634
So, quick question for you.

2069
01:33:29,883 --> 01:33:32,418
With our brand, we have a,

2070
01:33:32,418 --> 01:33:35,426
we run luxury fitness
gyms and beauty clinics,

2071
01:33:35,426 --> 01:33:39,042
and we're fortunate enough
to have a pretty big budget,

2072
01:33:39,042 --> 01:33:43,790
our budget for digital marketing
is about $100,000 a month,

2073
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,847
so it allows us to test a lot, right?

2074
01:33:45,847 --> 01:33:48,260
My question for you is, ultimately,

2075
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:51,725
we're trying to drive
sales and revenue, right?

2076
01:33:51,725 --> 01:33:52,932
- How much, how many,

2077
01:33:52,932 --> 01:33:55,569
how much of the 100,000 is being done on

2078
01:33:55,569 --> 01:33:59,366
bottom of the funnel transactional
membership versus brand?

2079
01:33:59,366 --> 01:34:00,454
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2080
01:34:00,454 --> 01:34:01,556
- [Man] All of it!

2081
01:34:01,556 --> 01:34:02,779
- That's the problem.

2082
01:34:02,779 --> 01:34:05,398
(audience laughing)

2083
01:34:05,398 --> 01:34:06,349
No, that's the problem.
- No, no, no,

2084
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:07,258
I agree with you, too,

2085
01:34:07,258 --> 01:34:08,846
that's where I'm going, so.
- I figured.

2086
01:34:08,846 --> 01:34:13,310
- [Man] We have about, a
cost of revenue KPI of 10%,

2087
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:15,914
meaning, if we spend 10
grand, we make 100 grand,

2088
01:34:15,914 --> 01:34:19,096
which is reasonably
efficient, my question is,

2089
01:34:19,096 --> 01:34:20,964
we're in agreement, our company,

2090
01:34:20,964 --> 01:34:23,744
that we have to spend
more on top of the funnel,

2091
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:27,530
and we do have a lot of KOLs,
we do have a PR network,

2092
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:30,512
we have celebrity ambassadors
and stuff like that.

2093
01:34:30,512 --> 01:34:31,994
- Can I give you the answer
to what you're looking for?

2094
01:34:31,994 --> 01:34:32,935
- [Man] Yes.

2095
01:34:32,935 --> 01:34:35,289
- Make the 80 cents on the dollar work

2096
01:34:35,289 --> 01:34:37,106
like the last 100 cents on the dollar,

2097
01:34:37,106 --> 01:34:39,750
so that you have no risk
on the 20 cents of a dollar

2098
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:42,903
to do the high risk,
high reward activity that

2099
01:34:42,903 --> 01:34:45,410
you need to take it to the next level.

2100
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:47,733
The answer always in this situation,

2101
01:34:47,733 --> 01:34:51,372
is taking a step back and
scrutinizing your own ability

2102
01:34:51,372 --> 01:34:54,372
to go on the real DR focused dollars

2103
01:34:55,258 --> 01:34:58,239
to cut 20 cents off the top,

2104
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:02,226
and make the 80 cents work
like the prior dollar worked,

2105
01:35:02,226 --> 01:35:06,792
and then you're basically in
no risk, high reward zone,

2106
01:35:06,792 --> 01:35:08,403
and then you cruise.

2107
01:35:08,403 --> 01:35:10,835
So, it's not mindlessly saying, okay,

2108
01:35:10,835 --> 01:35:12,652
we're gonna take this framework,

2109
01:35:12,652 --> 01:35:14,800
it's about becoming
way better at the thing

2110
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,351
that got you here to
give you the error cover

2111
01:35:17,351 --> 01:35:21,642
to the take the risks that
will get you to the next place.

2112
01:35:21,642 --> 01:35:22,663
- [Man] So, what you're saying is,

2113
01:35:22,663 --> 01:35:25,610
for short term loss on
conversions and revenue

2114
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:27,159
for long term brand building

2115
01:35:27,159 --> 01:35:28,860
and more top of the funnel then, right?

2116
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:30,855
- No, what I'm saying is don't lose any

2117
01:35:30,855 --> 01:35:35,124
short term sales conversion,
just get 20% better at that,

2118
01:35:35,124 --> 01:35:38,806
so that you have the 20% to play with.

2119
01:35:38,806 --> 01:35:40,537
- [Man] So, reallocate the other 20%

2120
01:35:40,537 --> 01:35:43,102
once we're able to grow
for more top of the funnel.

2121
01:35:43,102 --> 01:35:45,577
- Correct, take 20 cents on the dollar,

2122
01:35:45,577 --> 01:35:48,342
and spend 20,000 a month making a video

2123
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:50,530
that is your Dollar Shave Club,

2124
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:54,588
that could then take your CAC
on your DR stuff way down,

2125
01:35:54,588 --> 01:35:56,763
because you've built a brand,

2126
01:35:56,763 --> 01:35:59,659
but still make your 80 cents on the dollar

2127
01:35:59,659 --> 01:36:03,283
convert at the 10X, now it has to be 12X,

2128
01:36:03,283 --> 01:36:05,156
to make the old numbers work,

2129
01:36:05,156 --> 01:36:07,939
then there's no pressure from your CFO,

2130
01:36:07,939 --> 01:36:10,215
your ambassadors, or your CEO,

2131
01:36:10,215 --> 01:36:12,646
because now you've bought
yourself the freedom

2132
01:36:12,646 --> 01:36:15,663
to take risks, because
you made the 80 cents

2133
01:36:15,663 --> 01:36:18,074
act like the former dollar.

2134
01:36:18,074 --> 01:36:19,694
- [Man] Cool, thank you.

2135
01:36:19,694 --> 01:36:21,889
One more question, can
I get a selfie with you?

2136
01:36:21,889 --> 01:36:22,738
- Yep.

2137
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:24,843
- [Man] Alright, here we go.

2138
01:36:24,843 --> 01:36:26,266
And who am I giving this to?

2139
01:36:26,266 --> 01:36:28,266
- Whoever you decide to.

2140
01:36:29,918 --> 01:36:31,156
- [Man] I'm gonna be biased and give

2141
01:36:31,156 --> 01:36:34,829
it to our account manager on Facebook.

2142
01:36:34,829 --> 01:36:37,447
- That was very inside baseball.

2143
01:36:37,447 --> 01:36:39,863
- [Man] Former account manager, actually.

2144
01:36:39,863 --> 01:36:40,873
- Hey, man.

2145
01:36:40,873 --> 01:36:42,554
- [Vlad] Hey, Gary, I'm Vlad.

2146
01:36:42,554 --> 01:36:44,034
- Hey, Vlad.

2147
01:36:44,034 --> 01:36:45,537
- [Vlad] Thanks a lot
for being in Singapore,

2148
01:36:45,537 --> 01:36:47,611
it's awesome to have you here.

2149
01:36:47,611 --> 01:36:51,552
My question is, so, you've
been spending quite a bit

2150
01:36:51,552 --> 01:36:55,268
of time in Asia lately,
Hong Kong, Singapore,

2151
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:58,908
so, in your opinion,
where does the next wave

2152
01:36:58,908 --> 01:37:02,224
of media and tech innovation come from?

2153
01:37:02,224 --> 01:37:05,156
Does it come from Asia,
a lot of people say,

2154
01:37:05,156 --> 01:37:09,863
say a lot about China, does
it come from the U.S. still,

2155
01:37:09,863 --> 01:37:12,099
somewhere else, where do
you see the world going

2156
01:37:12,099 --> 01:37:13,565
in this respect?

2157
01:37:13,565 --> 01:37:14,686
- Can I ask you a question?

2158
01:37:14,686 --> 01:37:15,853
- [Vlad] Yeah.

2159
01:37:16,802 --> 01:37:19,141
- If, whatever the answer
is, what are you trying,

2160
01:37:19,141 --> 01:37:22,939
let me go a little bit, the
answer is from everywhere.

2161
01:37:22,939 --> 01:37:24,290
You know, I don't know,

2162
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:28,279
I'm fascinated by the
stardom of entrepreneurship,

2163
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:30,238
and what it means, for example,

2164
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:32,828
I'm fascinated with this
dream I keep having,

2165
01:37:32,828 --> 01:37:35,378
that there's some 13 year
old girl in India right now

2166
01:37:35,378 --> 01:37:39,020
that so looks up to Elon
Musk that she's gonna

2167
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:42,992
do something so crazy, and
I'm so pumped about that,

2168
01:37:42,992 --> 01:37:45,054
that's so incredible, right?

2169
01:37:45,054 --> 01:37:48,392
Anyway, the answer is everywhere.

2170
01:37:48,392 --> 01:37:52,399
The places that it's conducive
to happen is mainly America,

2171
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:56,989
mainly mainland China,
a little bit of Europe,

2172
01:37:56,989 --> 01:38:00,720
a little bit of southeast Asia,
a tiny bit of South America,

2173
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:03,825
so it's gonna be kind of
a lot of the same players,

2174
01:38:03,825 --> 01:38:06,618
because of the financial impacts,

2175
01:38:06,618 --> 01:38:11,473
the entrepreneurial branding
within those ecosystems,

2176
01:38:11,473 --> 01:38:14,723
the macro and micro economic scenarios,

2177
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:20,307
there's a lot of different
things that are happening.

2178
01:38:20,307 --> 01:38:22,741
But I think the more
interesting question for me is

2179
01:38:22,741 --> 01:38:24,377
why are you asking?

2180
01:38:24,377 --> 01:38:27,288
- [Vlad] Gotcha, so, I
guess for those of us who

2181
01:38:27,288 --> 01:38:30,587
build our businesses it's
important to know where

2182
01:38:30,587 --> 01:38:33,477
to focus on, do you
focus on the U.S. market,

2183
01:38:33,477 --> 01:38:36,210
do you focus on the China market?

2184
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,865
For those of us who are
employees and have careers,

2185
01:38:38,865 --> 01:38:41,021
where do you build your career towards,

2186
01:38:41,021 --> 01:38:42,333
to U.S., to China.
- I see.

2187
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:45,223
So, look, I think they're
two very different,

2188
01:38:45,223 --> 01:38:47,062
if we're talking about the
two kind of superpowers,

2189
01:38:47,062 --> 01:38:51,143
they're both very different,
and both very similar.

2190
01:38:51,143 --> 01:38:53,670
They have a lot of things going for them,

2191
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:56,902
and they have plenty of
shortcomings behind the scenes,

2192
01:38:56,902 --> 01:39:00,567
right, and for America now,
in front of the scenes, right?

2193
01:39:00,567 --> 01:39:02,100
So, I think,

2194
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:06,245
I think the thing that
you need to debate is

2195
01:39:06,245 --> 01:39:09,301
what feels more natural to you as a human.

2196
01:39:09,301 --> 01:39:10,640
What are you more comfortable with?

2197
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,351
Are you more comfortable with

2198
01:39:12,351 --> 01:39:16,518
an aging superpower empire that
is more purebred capitalist,

2199
01:39:17,764 --> 01:39:21,492
but is at maybe somewhere
between the third

2200
01:39:21,492 --> 01:39:25,425
or fourth quarter of its empire years,

2201
01:39:25,425 --> 01:39:28,072
or are you more interested in China,

2202
01:39:28,072 --> 01:39:31,140
which is in the beginning
of its empire run,

2203
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:33,019
but has, your name's Vlad?

2204
01:39:33,019 --> 01:39:34,292
- Yeah.
- You know,

2205
01:39:34,292 --> 01:39:36,972
it's very hard for guys
named Genazi and Vlad

2206
01:39:36,972 --> 01:39:39,765
to completely be super
comfortable with any

2207
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:43,109
level of communism, even if
it's disguised as capitalism,

2208
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:44,115
right?
- Yep.

2209
01:39:44,115 --> 01:39:47,079
So, you just have to make
a decision for yourself,

2210
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:48,648
as a human, my parents,

2211
01:39:48,648 --> 01:39:51,526
I've never been back to the Soviet Union,

2212
01:39:51,526 --> 01:39:53,484
because there's such negative feelings

2213
01:39:53,484 --> 01:39:55,602
for what went down there for my family,

2214
01:39:55,602 --> 01:39:57,823
that I would never, I
don't feel, even though,

2215
01:39:57,823 --> 01:40:00,094
so, I think China runs its country

2216
01:40:00,094 --> 01:40:03,465
like most successful businesses.

2217
01:40:03,465 --> 01:40:06,815
Some mix of capitalism, and
when needed, dictatorship.

2218
01:40:06,815 --> 01:40:10,017
VaynerMedia is far more
similar to China than it is

2219
01:40:10,017 --> 01:40:11,767
to the United States.

2220
01:40:13,323 --> 01:40:15,240
As for the human question,

2221
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,952
you just have to ask yourself
where you'd rather live.

2222
01:40:18,952 --> 01:40:21,150
Both are gonna be just fine

2223
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:22,652
by the time you die.

2224
01:40:22,652 --> 01:40:25,621
(audience laughing)

2225
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:26,641
- [Vlad] Gotcha, thanks a lot.

2226
01:40:26,641 --> 01:40:28,223
- You got it.

2227
01:40:28,223 --> 01:40:32,187
(audience members yelling)

2228
01:40:32,187 --> 01:40:34,854
(Gary laughing)

2229
01:40:36,275 --> 01:40:38,046
- [Harry] I finally caught one.

2230
01:40:38,046 --> 01:40:39,577
Hey, Gary.
- How are you?

2231
01:40:39,577 --> 01:40:41,644
- [Harry] I'm good, thank you, I'm Harry.

2232
01:40:41,644 --> 01:40:43,311
We're from Malaysia.

2233
01:40:44,565 --> 01:40:47,040
We're actually aesthetic company.

2234
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,785
- A static?
- Aesthetic.

2235
01:40:48,785 --> 01:40:49,836
Like, beauty clinic.

2236
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:51,253
- Got it, got it.

2237
01:40:52,266 --> 01:40:56,504
- [Harry] We've been running
the business for four years.

2238
01:40:56,504 --> 01:41:00,257
For the past three years,
we've been using traditional

2239
01:41:00,257 --> 01:41:02,562
marketing, and this year--
- What do you defer,

2240
01:41:02,562 --> 01:41:05,556
what you consider traditional
marketing, direct mail?

2241
01:41:05,556 --> 01:41:09,639
- [Harry] Like, word of
mouth, brochures, agents,

2242
01:41:11,191 --> 01:41:15,358
and this year, we're starting
to get into digital marketing.

2243
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,595
- And what do you call digital?

2244
01:41:19,595 --> 01:41:22,864
Social or Google or banner
or programmatic or what?

2245
01:41:22,864 --> 01:41:27,804
- [Harry] We are actually
trying to go into Google,

2246
01:41:27,804 --> 01:41:28,637
YouTubes,

2247
01:41:29,787 --> 01:41:31,282
SEO,

2248
01:41:31,282 --> 01:41:33,255
and social media

2249
01:41:33,255 --> 01:41:34,535
at once.

2250
01:41:34,535 --> 01:41:36,624
Right now, we're actually working on it,

2251
01:41:36,624 --> 01:41:40,555
with where we sell knowledge about it,

2252
01:41:40,555 --> 01:41:43,472
and I have these questions for you,

2253
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:49,176
I would like to get some advice from you

2254
01:41:49,176 --> 01:41:50,926
on how can we podcast

2255
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:55,259
our thing.

2256
01:41:55,259 --> 01:41:56,510
- Podcast?
- Podcast, like,

2257
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:59,593
any advice on the trends on podcasts.

2258
01:42:00,528 --> 01:42:03,368
- And so, you want a podcast, why?

2259
01:42:03,368 --> 01:42:05,089
- [Harry] Like, a video.

2260
01:42:05,089 --> 01:42:08,313
- But why do you wanna do it?

2261
01:42:08,313 --> 01:42:11,230
- [Harry] Well, we wanted to, like,

2262
01:42:12,499 --> 01:42:14,582
showcase to our consumer.

2263
01:42:15,703 --> 01:42:16,710
- What you're doing?

2264
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:18,196
- [Harry] Yeah, what we're doing,

2265
01:42:18,196 --> 01:42:21,491
and to make them understand
better than what we've

2266
01:42:21,491 --> 01:42:23,991
been trying to do, back demand.

2267
01:42:25,345 --> 01:42:27,161
- Okay, so the first thing is,

2268
01:42:27,161 --> 01:42:30,027
the way you've been doing
marketing traditionally,

2269
01:42:30,027 --> 01:42:32,277
is far more sales oriented.

2270
01:42:33,151 --> 01:42:35,728
You've had an agent resell,
you've done brochures,

2271
01:42:35,728 --> 01:42:37,943
you're doing selling.

2272
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:42,582
A podcast is the furthest
thing from selling that I know.

2273
01:42:42,582 --> 01:42:45,990
It's over here, it's called branding.

2274
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,823
Sellers,

2275
01:42:48,092 --> 01:42:51,842
for four years or three
years, hate branding.

2276
01:42:52,676 --> 01:42:54,141
You know why?

2277
01:42:54,141 --> 01:42:58,807
It costs money up front,
and nothing good happens.

2278
01:42:58,807 --> 01:43:00,722
For the first year.

2279
01:43:00,722 --> 01:43:03,399
So, first and foremost, I
wanna make sure that you

2280
01:43:03,399 --> 01:43:05,672
know what you're getting yourself into,

2281
01:43:05,672 --> 01:43:08,063
which is, if you start a podcast,

2282
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:10,340
it's gonna take up a lot of time,

2283
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:12,138
it's gonna cost some money,

2284
01:43:12,138 --> 01:43:15,535
and very little is gonna
happen in the first year.

2285
01:43:15,535 --> 01:43:17,768
So, somewhere around nine
months after you start

2286
01:43:17,768 --> 01:43:20,360
your podcast, you two are
gonna look at each other

2287
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:23,569
and say, Gary Vee is an asshole.

2288
01:43:23,569 --> 01:43:25,530
(Harry laughing)

2289
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:28,162
As long as you know that,

2290
01:43:28,162 --> 01:43:31,103
then I'm excited for you to do a podcast,

2291
01:43:31,103 --> 01:43:33,403
because that over time branding,

2292
01:43:33,403 --> 01:43:36,482
if you do and execute a good podcast,

2293
01:43:36,482 --> 01:43:38,758
will have very big effects,

2294
01:43:38,758 --> 01:43:41,801
but before you jump into podcasts,

2295
01:43:41,801 --> 01:43:45,063
since you've never even
done digital marketing,

2296
01:43:45,063 --> 01:43:47,874
I don't want you to go too far out

2297
01:43:47,874 --> 01:43:51,403
and just do it because
I said audio's good,

2298
01:43:51,403 --> 01:43:55,357
I want you to be grounded in
what you're doing and how.

2299
01:43:55,357 --> 01:43:58,235
You're such a heavy sales organization,

2300
01:43:58,235 --> 01:44:00,483
that I wanna make sure that you know

2301
01:44:00,483 --> 01:44:03,683
what you're going into, do
I think the sales on digital

2302
01:44:03,683 --> 01:44:07,433
can do better than your brochures, 100%.

2303
01:44:08,478 --> 01:44:12,249
Do I think the agents are
reselling right and referring?

2304
01:44:12,249 --> 01:44:14,190
I would triple down on that,

2305
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:16,882
'cause that's always a good sales engine.

2306
01:44:16,882 --> 01:44:18,769
Right, yes, they get a piece of the pie,

2307
01:44:18,769 --> 01:44:21,979
but they're basically a workforce, right?

2308
01:44:21,979 --> 01:44:26,126
But I would get really good
at Facebook conversion ads,

2309
01:44:26,126 --> 01:44:29,209
and very good at SCO, and mainly SCM,

2310
01:44:30,517 --> 01:44:32,647
to be honest, more than SCO,

2311
01:44:32,647 --> 01:44:36,446
but before you begin to really
be committed to podcasts,

2312
01:44:36,446 --> 01:44:40,004
now, if you've got the
money to do all of it,

2313
01:44:40,004 --> 01:44:42,829
and you're okay with
wasting money and time

2314
01:44:42,829 --> 01:44:44,452
and year one on the podcast

2315
01:44:44,452 --> 01:44:47,461
to have a little bit more
opportunity in year two,

2316
01:44:47,461 --> 01:44:49,752
then that's great, but
you have to be smart,

2317
01:44:49,752 --> 01:44:52,786
and think about it from
a practical standpoint,

2318
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:55,286
not an ideological standpoint.

2319
01:44:58,347 --> 01:44:59,600
- [Harry] I have another question.

2320
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,492
- Sure.

2321
01:45:00,492 --> 01:45:04,659
- [Harry] Well, we're trying
to figure out our budget

2322
01:45:05,529 --> 01:45:07,676
into digital marketing into.

2323
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:09,647
- As much as you can afford.

2324
01:45:09,647 --> 01:45:11,247
- [Harry] As much as we can afford.

2325
01:45:11,247 --> 01:45:13,899
Should we spend it equally in Google?

2326
01:45:13,899 --> 01:45:15,998
- You should spend 50% of it up front,

2327
01:45:15,998 --> 01:45:19,926
tasting everything and then
double down on what's working.

2328
01:45:19,926 --> 01:45:21,697
So, if you're gonna spend 100,000,

2329
01:45:21,697 --> 01:45:24,303
spend 50,000 in the
first three, four months,

2330
01:45:24,303 --> 01:45:26,031
try a lot of different things,

2331
01:45:26,031 --> 01:45:28,362
and become good at
understanding what's happening,

2332
01:45:28,362 --> 01:45:30,008
and then double down.

2333
01:45:30,008 --> 01:45:31,980
- [Harry] Do you think it's recommended

2334
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:34,480
if we use YouTube as a channel

2335
01:45:36,734 --> 01:45:39,237
to do the conversion rate,

2336
01:45:39,237 --> 01:45:41,337
do you think it's possible using YouTube

2337
01:45:41,337 --> 01:45:43,254
to, for convert?
- Sure.

2338
01:45:44,386 --> 01:45:46,863
I mean, of course, but it's difficult.

2339
01:45:46,863 --> 01:45:49,529
Now, there is a product
that you should look at.

2340
01:45:49,529 --> 01:45:51,082
There's a way to target people with

2341
01:45:51,082 --> 01:45:53,165
a YouTube pre-roll video,

2342
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:58,195
that is based on what
they searched on Google.

2343
01:45:58,195 --> 01:46:01,592
I think it's an incredible
product for all of you.

2344
01:46:01,592 --> 01:46:05,352
Google, YouTube has a
pre-roll video product

2345
01:46:05,352 --> 01:46:08,366
that you can target against what people

2346
01:46:08,366 --> 01:46:10,862
are searching for on Google.

2347
01:46:10,862 --> 01:46:12,521
So, as you can imagine,

2348
01:46:12,521 --> 01:46:15,332
if I'm searching on
Google how to drink wine,

2349
01:46:15,332 --> 01:46:18,151
or wine things, even if I go to YouTube

2350
01:46:18,151 --> 01:46:20,790
and watch Jets football videos,

2351
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:24,064
it's gonna service me wine ads up front.

2352
01:46:24,064 --> 01:46:27,349
If somebody's on Google
searching beauty or spas

2353
01:46:27,349 --> 01:46:30,833
or the words you know, your video,

2354
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:33,425
even if they're watching
kitten videos on YouTube,

2355
01:46:33,425 --> 01:46:36,507
being a pre-roll is gonna convert better.

2356
01:46:36,507 --> 01:46:39,142
This is what I mean about
being a practitioner

2357
01:46:39,142 --> 01:46:41,217
versus a headline reader.

2358
01:46:41,217 --> 01:46:45,160
Gotta know these nuances to be successful.

2359
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:46,699
- [Harry] Can I have a last request?

2360
01:46:46,699 --> 01:46:48,325
We would like to have a wefie.

2361
01:46:48,325 --> 01:46:49,249
Is it possible?

2362
01:46:49,249 --> 01:46:50,082
- A what?

2363
01:46:50,082 --> 01:46:51,189
- [Harry] A wefie.

2364
01:46:51,189 --> 01:46:52,285
- A wefie, like,

2365
01:46:52,285 --> 01:46:53,408
we, in a selfie?
- We, together, yes.

2366
01:46:53,408 --> 01:46:54,453
- Yes, okay, that sounds cool.

2367
01:46:54,453 --> 01:46:57,164
Bring the mic up, oh,
you're gonna ask a question?

2368
01:46:57,164 --> 01:46:58,418
Then I'm gonna have you bring it up.

2369
01:46:58,418 --> 01:46:59,498
Anybody over there want, okay.

2370
01:46:59,498 --> 01:47:00,331
Go ahead.

2371
01:47:03,595 --> 01:47:05,160
Yeah, we can do it now.

2372
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,938
- [Elkar] Okay, so, first
thing that I want to say,

2373
01:47:07,938 --> 01:47:09,581
is a big thank you.
- Thank you.

2374
01:47:09,581 --> 01:47:11,239
- [Elkar] So, for everything
that you've been doing,

2375
01:47:11,239 --> 01:47:12,709
the content that you've been putting out,

2376
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:15,844
so inspirational that first
thing to express on this,

2377
01:47:15,844 --> 01:47:18,208
this exchange is gratitude.

2378
01:47:18,208 --> 01:47:19,582
- Thank you, brother.

2379
01:47:19,582 --> 01:47:20,415
What's your name?

2380
01:47:20,415 --> 01:47:21,764
- [Elkar] My name is Elkar,

2381
01:47:21,764 --> 01:47:24,324
I'm from Brazil with
business here in Singapore.

2382
01:47:24,324 --> 01:47:25,290
- [Gary] I'm listening.

2383
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:28,154
- [Elkar] Okay, so, we're
running a VR startup

2384
01:47:28,154 --> 01:47:29,525
here in Singapore.
- Okay.

2385
01:47:29,525 --> 01:47:30,876
- B2B.
- Okay, good.

2386
01:47:30,876 --> 01:47:33,912
- [Elkar] And it focus
on the luxury market,

2387
01:47:33,912 --> 01:47:37,905
and as you may know, VR
is so in the early stages,

2388
01:47:37,905 --> 01:47:41,390
and we don't have, even
in the world or U.S.,

2389
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:43,922
big success cases, large scale,

2390
01:47:43,922 --> 01:47:47,206
that can make sales a
little bit challenging.

2391
01:47:47,206 --> 01:47:48,758
If you're doing, we're doing well,

2392
01:47:48,758 --> 01:47:50,960
we just want to see if you
have any thoughts to say.

2393
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,804
- I do, I have some
real thoughts on B2B VR.

2394
01:47:53,804 --> 01:47:56,756
I'm very much a big fan
of you tying your business

2395
01:47:56,756 --> 01:48:00,673
very close to experiential
and event marketing.

2396
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:04,527
The place where you can find budget

2397
01:48:04,527 --> 01:48:08,158
is when brands and businesses
are activating in real life

2398
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:12,542
at big events where VR
experiences are the draw

2399
01:48:12,542 --> 01:48:15,247
for them to get people
to come to their booth

2400
01:48:15,247 --> 01:48:17,207
or their exposition or their,

2401
01:48:17,207 --> 01:48:20,749
it is the only place that
I think is really viable

2402
01:48:20,749 --> 01:48:23,082
in a B2B environment for VR.

2403
01:48:24,662 --> 01:48:27,156
- [Elkar] So, that's where we're going,

2404
01:48:27,156 --> 01:48:29,560
because we're selling boats, yachts,

2405
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:33,060
so, the big advantage point is boat shows,

2406
01:48:34,095 --> 01:48:36,701
so there's a place for us to, so we try,

2407
01:48:36,701 --> 01:48:38,400
we've been in Europe, like to talk to.

2408
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,250
- Or, or, to be a little more creative,

2409
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:43,341
as well, just high luxury,

2410
01:48:43,341 --> 01:48:46,913
high affluent areas where
you can do activations.

2411
01:48:46,913 --> 01:48:50,235
Art Basel is a place
where a brand or company

2412
01:48:50,235 --> 01:48:53,272
may wanna activate a VR yacht experience,

2413
01:48:53,272 --> 01:48:56,871
just because of the rich
people that are running around,

2414
01:48:56,871 --> 01:49:00,978
so you should map the 100
biggest rich people events,

2415
01:49:00,978 --> 01:49:03,077
and then reach out to the people that have

2416
01:49:03,077 --> 01:49:05,350
exhibited there in the past and see

2417
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:08,746
if they want a hook to draw people in.

2418
01:49:08,746 --> 01:49:10,448
- [Elkar] Okay, that's a great idea.

2419
01:49:10,448 --> 01:49:12,637
When are we talking to the
shipbuilder, for instance,

2420
01:49:12,637 --> 01:49:15,113
right, so one of the
challenges is actually

2421
01:49:15,113 --> 01:49:17,921
to express other VR
cases, because, for them,

2422
01:49:17,921 --> 01:49:20,339
I think that it is completely new, right,

2423
01:49:20,339 --> 01:49:25,319
so, it's difficult for us
to see, to prove our pitch.

2424
01:49:25,319 --> 01:49:28,415
Any ideas how can we
bring those guys on board,

2425
01:49:28,415 --> 01:49:32,664
even though we don't have
other cases, U.S. or.

2426
01:49:32,664 --> 01:49:34,418
- You mean they're
looking for case studies

2427
01:49:34,418 --> 01:49:35,671
of other people that did it?

2428
01:49:35,671 --> 01:49:37,672
Yeah, I mean, this has
been my whole career.

2429
01:49:37,672 --> 01:49:41,168
The answer is you don't have them.

2430
01:49:41,168 --> 01:49:44,136
Same answer I gave that nice Uber driver.

2431
01:49:44,136 --> 01:49:47,649
As soon as they say, I need
a case study to move forward,

2432
01:49:47,649 --> 01:49:50,471
they're not in the VR business.

2433
01:49:50,471 --> 01:49:51,304
Got it?

2434
01:49:51,304 --> 01:49:52,319
- [Elkar] Yeah, makes sense.

2435
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:53,653
- Make a big list.

2436
01:49:53,653 --> 01:49:55,625
When you're selling the future,

2437
01:49:55,625 --> 01:49:57,989
the answer is always make a big list,

2438
01:49:57,989 --> 01:50:01,098
'cause you're gonna get a
lot more nos than yeses.

2439
01:50:01,098 --> 01:50:02,248
- [Elkar] Okay, thank you so much.

2440
01:50:02,248 --> 01:50:07,100
Just one last thing, you
have the VaynerBeta program,

2441
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:08,871
can you show a little
bit more about it, or.

2442
01:50:08,871 --> 01:50:10,972
- It's $25,000 a month

2443
01:50:10,972 --> 01:50:14,242
for us to do the marketing
for small businesses,

2444
01:50:14,242 --> 01:50:16,501
and it's a very watered down version

2445
01:50:16,501 --> 01:50:19,138
of what VaynerMedia does
for the biggest brands.

2446
01:50:19,138 --> 01:50:21,023
But it finally got to a place where

2447
01:50:21,023 --> 01:50:23,618
I believed enough in
it to actually sell it.

2448
01:50:23,618 --> 01:50:27,341
So, I think it's ROI
positive in a $300,000 macro

2449
01:50:27,341 --> 01:50:30,553
for small and medium sized businesses,

2450
01:50:30,553 --> 01:50:32,784
but obviously, not that small.

2451
01:50:32,784 --> 01:50:36,660
$300,000 for content and
distribution in social networks

2452
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:39,422
is for a business doing some real revenue.

2453
01:50:39,422 --> 01:50:41,627
- Thanks, thanks so much.
- Awesome.

2454
01:50:41,627 --> 01:50:42,575
Can you give me the mic?

2455
01:50:42,575 --> 01:50:45,020
- [Man] Gary, Gary, five more minutes.

2456
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:46,951
- Oh, you have, what?
- Five more minutes.

2457
01:50:46,951 --> 01:50:48,307
- Okay, good, this way, here,

2458
01:50:48,307 --> 01:50:49,975
give it to me, 'cause
I wanna give it, yeah.

2459
01:50:49,975 --> 01:50:50,808
Yep.

2460
01:50:52,047 --> 01:50:53,360
Nice.

2461
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:54,852
- [Man] Or if you would
like to take it longer,

2462
01:50:54,852 --> 01:50:57,019
it's okay, it's up to you.

2463
01:51:00,677 --> 01:51:02,026
- Hey, Gary.
- Hey, brother.

2464
01:51:02,026 --> 01:51:05,193
- [Man] Speaking of that product,

2465
01:51:05,193 --> 01:51:06,895
there is a lot of, for me,

2466
01:51:06,895 --> 01:51:09,399
on social media, there's a lot of,

2467
01:51:09,399 --> 01:51:11,703
sorry, I fucking hate
public speaking, by the way.

2468
01:51:11,703 --> 01:51:15,018
- No worries, nobody's judging.

2469
01:51:15,018 --> 01:51:16,901
- [Man] So there's a lot
of shit that I see on

2470
01:51:16,901 --> 01:51:18,672
social media, it just
seems like people are just

2471
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:20,571
churning and churning
and churning content.

2472
01:51:20,571 --> 01:51:23,082
I can see the reason why
people are hiring you

2473
01:51:23,082 --> 01:51:25,930
for their product, when
would you advise people

2474
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:29,470
to kind of step back and hone their skills

2475
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:32,856
and sharpen the sword, versus just, like,

2476
01:51:32,856 --> 01:51:35,630
it was a big thing that
everyone said today

2477
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:37,918
is take action, take action, take action,

2478
01:51:37,918 --> 01:51:40,237
but there's obviously a time to sharpen.

2479
01:51:40,237 --> 01:51:43,421
- To be thoughtful.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2480
01:51:43,421 --> 01:51:44,442
How do you make that.

2481
01:51:44,442 --> 01:51:46,757
- Let's make it a little
bit more selfish for you,

2482
01:51:46,757 --> 01:51:48,805
what are you trying to figure out?

2483
01:51:48,805 --> 01:51:52,972
- [Man] Alright, so I was, I
transitioned recently from,

2484
01:51:54,235 --> 01:51:58,147
I was in the fitness space,
I was a fitness influencer,

2485
01:51:58,147 --> 01:52:00,120
I was one of the, in the U.K.,

2486
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:03,734
amongst the first kind of
young people to get really big,

2487
01:52:03,734 --> 01:52:08,022
and that kind of took off
on Instagram, on Twitter.

2488
01:52:08,022 --> 01:52:10,367
I then got sick of that industry,

2489
01:52:10,367 --> 01:52:12,450
and transitioned into the

2490
01:52:14,643 --> 01:52:17,367
content based, so, film and media,

2491
01:52:17,367 --> 01:52:21,170
previous to that, just
a prerequisite that,

2492
01:52:21,170 --> 01:52:24,045
I created a business,
like, an app for discounts,

2493
01:52:24,045 --> 01:52:28,392
a niche discount app in
the U.K., and it blew up.

2494
01:52:28,392 --> 01:52:30,310
Got bored of that, so, like,

2495
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:32,714
got bored of fitness,
got bored of the app.

2496
01:52:32,714 --> 01:52:33,881
Transitioning,

2497
01:52:35,989 --> 01:52:36,822
and,

2498
01:52:38,265 --> 01:52:41,604
I kind of, I'm at the
point where I'm like,

2499
01:52:41,604 --> 01:52:43,939
right now I get up at four a.m. every day,

2500
01:52:43,939 --> 01:52:47,106
I'm studying film, I'm studying media,

2501
01:52:48,358 --> 01:52:50,578
and everyone around me is just like

2502
01:52:50,578 --> 01:52:53,299
always create, create, create, but, to me,

2503
01:52:53,299 --> 01:52:56,293
this is a time for me to sharpen my sword

2504
01:52:56,293 --> 01:52:58,082
and get my content to a level where it can

2505
01:52:58,082 --> 01:52:59,392
actually gain attention.

2506
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,889
- I like it.

2507
01:53:00,889 --> 01:53:02,327
- [Man] I just wanna know when,

2508
01:53:02,327 --> 01:53:04,011
when, when, when you have done that,

2509
01:53:04,011 --> 01:53:06,414
'cause you pulled back on your
content body for eight years,

2510
01:53:06,414 --> 01:53:08,347
when are you deciding
to pull back and learn

2511
01:53:08,347 --> 01:53:10,160
and then to execute.

2512
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:12,838
- For me, based on the
content I'm putting out,

2513
01:53:12,838 --> 01:53:14,956
it's when I feel like there's something

2514
01:53:14,956 --> 01:53:19,549
really meaningful to talk
about, then I wanna get louder.

2515
01:53:19,549 --> 01:53:21,058
Right, like I talked about earlier.

2516
01:53:21,058 --> 01:53:24,510
For you, it sounds like you're
doing original creative,

2517
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:25,897
I'm asking.
- Yeah, yes.

2518
01:53:25,897 --> 01:53:27,739
- It's more like nonfiction?

2519
01:53:27,739 --> 01:53:29,762
- [Man] Yeah, nonfiction.

2520
01:53:29,762 --> 01:53:32,580
- To me then, it would be
when you feel it's ready.

2521
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:36,997
Right, I don't think your,
now, what I will say is,

2522
01:53:36,997 --> 01:53:40,236
don't be scared to put
a little bit out there,

2523
01:53:40,236 --> 01:53:43,205
remember how I, or I did
that in an interview,

2524
01:53:43,205 --> 01:53:44,626
I didn't say it on stage yet.

2525
01:53:44,626 --> 01:53:47,043
Nobody remembers your losses.

2526
01:53:47,885 --> 01:53:51,810
George Lucas had movies before Star Wars.

2527
01:53:51,810 --> 01:53:54,894
You know, so I wouldn't
be super duper scared

2528
01:53:54,894 --> 01:53:56,792
of putting some stuff out there,

2529
01:53:56,792 --> 01:53:59,210
we're not gonna judge, that was crappy,

2530
01:53:59,210 --> 01:54:01,127
now you can't win on the next thing.

2531
01:54:01,127 --> 01:54:03,275
The other thing is you
could be very thoughtful,

2532
01:54:03,275 --> 01:54:05,317
and put out little pieces of content that

2533
01:54:05,317 --> 01:54:09,046
are parts of the story, Tim
Ferriss sold 4-Hour Workweek

2534
01:54:09,046 --> 01:54:12,487
because he used Google and
tested six different titles,

2535
01:54:12,487 --> 01:54:14,541
or four, I don't remember the story,

2536
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:17,408
but he saw consumers'
intent around that title,

2537
01:54:17,408 --> 01:54:19,238
and it really worked.

2538
01:54:19,238 --> 01:54:20,766
I see a lot of the same happening

2539
01:54:20,766 --> 01:54:22,806
in original content online.

2540
01:54:22,806 --> 01:54:25,933
You could run really smart shit,

2541
01:54:25,933 --> 01:54:28,196
I would create a fake Facebook page,

2542
01:54:28,196 --> 01:54:31,450
some other brand that's not
gonna be your coming out party,

2543
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:35,260
put some content there, run
$50 worth of ads against

2544
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:37,452
the demo you think you're reaching,

2545
01:54:37,452 --> 01:54:40,315
and look at the quantitative
and qualitative feedback,

2546
01:54:40,315 --> 01:54:41,756
and it might give you some insight

2547
01:54:41,756 --> 01:54:44,433
if the sword is sharp enough
to take out of the shed.

2548
01:54:44,433 --> 01:54:46,635
See what I mean?
- Yeah, no, I get it.

2549
01:54:46,635 --> 01:54:48,942
- I think there's a way for
you to use it as offense

2550
01:54:48,942 --> 01:54:51,723
instead of looking at it as detrimental.

2551
01:54:51,723 --> 01:54:52,769
- [Man] That makes sense.

2552
01:54:52,769 --> 01:54:55,390
- Because, to your point, and
it's using your own words,

2553
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:57,938
there's so much being put out now

2554
01:54:57,938 --> 01:55:00,845
that people are forgetting,

2555
01:55:00,845 --> 01:55:03,959
like, our attention span is so zero,

2556
01:55:03,959 --> 01:55:07,631
there's very little damage
you can do to the IP,

2557
01:55:07,631 --> 01:55:10,446
compared to the way it
plays out in your head.

2558
01:55:10,446 --> 01:55:13,486
I always tell all my friends,
nobody really gives a shit.

2559
01:55:13,486 --> 01:55:16,819
You know, you do, 'cause it's your baby.

2560
01:55:18,888 --> 01:55:21,840
It's why I put out so much content.

2561
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,973
I think it's all good enough,

2562
01:55:23,973 --> 01:55:26,548
and if it's not the greatest
thing for the world,

2563
01:55:26,548 --> 01:55:29,154
that's okay, learn from it, I'm
putting it out there, right?

2564
01:55:29,154 --> 01:55:31,545
For me, I wanna get it out there, but,

2565
01:55:31,545 --> 01:55:34,162
you know, I think you
should use it as an offense.

2566
01:55:34,162 --> 01:55:35,647
- [Man] Nice, I appreciate
that, thank you.

2567
01:55:35,647 --> 01:55:36,730
- You got it.

2568
01:55:38,493 --> 01:55:40,073
- [Micheal] Hi, Gary.

2569
01:55:40,073 --> 01:55:41,024
- How are you?

2570
01:55:41,024 --> 01:55:42,365
- [Michael] I'm good, thank you.

2571
01:55:42,365 --> 01:55:44,897
I'm Michael, from Perth, in
Australia, three of us came out.

2572
01:55:44,897 --> 01:55:45,834
- That's awesome, thank you.

2573
01:55:45,834 --> 01:55:47,980
Know it well, grew up
in the wine business,

2574
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:49,134
been there plenty of times.

2575
01:55:49,134 --> 01:55:50,758
- [Michael] The Swan
Valley to Margaret River?

2576
01:55:50,758 --> 01:55:53,002
Beautiful, beautiful.
- I know it well.

2577
01:55:53,002 --> 01:55:55,076
- [Michael] This one's
a little bit off topic,

2578
01:55:55,076 --> 01:55:57,755
a little bit, over the last year or so,

2579
01:55:57,755 --> 01:56:00,498
I've been going down a bit
of a philosophical road,

2580
01:56:00,498 --> 01:56:02,493
thinking about life,
could be a midlife thing,

2581
01:56:02,493 --> 01:56:05,493
I don't know, and I notice that you,

2582
01:56:06,728 --> 01:56:08,715
I think that you're
probably one of the great

2583
01:56:08,715 --> 01:56:11,408
philosophers of our modern age, I think,

2584
01:56:11,408 --> 01:56:15,218
away from branding, away from marketing,

2585
01:56:15,218 --> 01:56:17,221
and I've loved your
content with Ryan Holiday

2586
01:56:17,221 --> 01:56:19,225
and stuff like that.

2587
01:56:19,225 --> 01:56:20,967
I'm wondering if, at some stage,

2588
01:56:20,967 --> 01:56:25,145
you may write a book,
away from, as I said,

2589
01:56:25,145 --> 01:56:26,855
the marketing and social media stuff,

2590
01:56:26,855 --> 01:56:29,275
and more about sort of your life lessons,

2591
01:56:29,275 --> 01:56:31,386
like the famous three
words, you're gonna die,

2592
01:56:31,386 --> 01:56:32,770
that sort of stuff.

2593
01:56:32,770 --> 01:56:33,603
- Yeah.

2594
01:56:34,586 --> 01:56:35,484
- [Michael] Good.

2595
01:56:35,484 --> 01:56:36,877
I'll buy it.

2596
01:56:36,877 --> 01:56:39,970
- I think yes, and I think you clearly

2597
01:56:39,970 --> 01:56:42,736
kind of see what's going on.

2598
01:56:42,736 --> 01:56:45,165
I think I, look, I'm writing a book

2599
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:48,236
called Perfectly Parented,
it's a parenting book.

2600
01:56:48,236 --> 01:56:49,472
- [Michael] So it's, you are writing.

2601
01:56:49,472 --> 01:56:50,465
- I am writing that.

2602
01:56:50,465 --> 01:56:54,632
I think of doing some pretty
hardcore philosophies,

2603
01:56:55,780 --> 01:56:59,034
and then blending it
down into a little bit

2604
01:56:59,034 --> 01:57:01,851
more tactical in subject matter,

2605
01:57:01,851 --> 01:57:03,667
I think I'm gonna evolve, right?

2606
01:57:03,667 --> 01:57:08,218
I think even if you look
at early Wine Library TV,

2607
01:57:08,218 --> 01:57:10,967
I'm starting to throw
life lessons into the,

2608
01:57:10,967 --> 01:57:13,033
it's a wine show and I was doing it,

2609
01:57:13,033 --> 01:57:15,435
right now I'm into this marketing thing,

2610
01:57:15,435 --> 01:57:17,435
but my intuition is yes.

2611
01:57:18,452 --> 01:57:19,332
- [Michael] Yeah, that's great,

2612
01:57:19,332 --> 01:57:21,405
'cause I think 500 years
from now, whenever,

2613
01:57:21,405 --> 01:57:23,147
I think you'll be
remembered as a philosopher

2614
01:57:23,147 --> 01:57:26,125
more than a marketer, I think.

2615
01:57:26,125 --> 01:57:28,689
- You know, I think my ego's
very happy with you right now.

2616
01:57:28,689 --> 01:57:30,487
(audience laughing)

2617
01:57:30,487 --> 01:57:31,832
- [Michael] Ego is the enemy, remember?

2618
01:57:31,832 --> 01:57:34,825
- But I would tell you that

2619
01:57:34,825 --> 01:57:36,881
it's how I think of myself much more.

2620
01:57:36,881 --> 01:57:40,714
I think my stuff is very
heavy, philosophical,

2621
01:57:42,599 --> 01:57:46,766
what saved me from being too
heavy is my love of execution,

2622
01:57:48,795 --> 01:57:52,011
and I think I've forced
myself lower down the funnel

2623
01:57:52,011 --> 01:57:55,673
of my philosophies to make
them tangible and useful,

2624
01:57:55,673 --> 01:57:57,768
but yeah, I think I have
heavy themes in that world,

2625
01:57:57,768 --> 01:58:00,353
which is why it feels native to you,

2626
01:58:00,353 --> 01:58:02,916
and I do think that the people that,

2627
01:58:02,916 --> 01:58:05,522
if you listen carefully to even today,

2628
01:58:05,522 --> 01:58:07,336
people are getting a lot more value out

2629
01:58:07,336 --> 01:58:11,503
of my structure of thinking
than I gave you some tidbit,

2630
01:58:12,361 --> 01:58:14,150
you know, I love when people are like,

2631
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:16,680
Gary Vee, you suck, you know, I love this,

2632
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:18,883
this is my favorite, why
don't you give us like,

2633
01:58:18,883 --> 01:58:22,423
an actual piece of advice,
enough of this hustle and go,

2634
01:58:22,423 --> 01:58:24,711
and la la la, and I always
laugh, I'm like, dude,

2635
01:58:24,711 --> 01:58:29,448
and I reply, 'cause I love
it, I'm like, dude, Google it.

2636
01:58:29,448 --> 01:58:32,432
You can Google anything tangible.

2637
01:58:32,432 --> 01:58:34,129
You wanna learn how to use hashtags,

2638
01:58:34,129 --> 01:58:35,901
you wanna learn how to
edit YouTube videos,

2639
01:58:35,901 --> 01:58:39,426
you wanna learn how to
create Snapchat filters?

2640
01:58:39,426 --> 01:58:43,516
You don't need a guru to
sell you an $80 eBook.

2641
01:58:43,516 --> 01:58:46,671
It's free, it's called
https://www.google.com.

2642
01:58:46,671 --> 01:58:49,692
To me, I think the stuff
we talk about philosophical

2643
01:58:49,692 --> 01:58:53,436
is imperative, 'cause it
becomes your life's strategy,

2644
01:58:53,436 --> 01:58:57,022
which then dictates your activities,

2645
01:58:57,022 --> 01:59:01,196
like, him not being
impatient and going wide

2646
01:59:01,196 --> 01:59:04,808
is disproportionately more
valuable for his business

2647
01:59:04,808 --> 01:59:08,682
than me telling him to use, you know,

2648
01:59:08,682 --> 01:59:11,462
RED in a post on LinkedIn
that will convert

2649
01:59:11,462 --> 01:59:13,545
you know, 1% higher.

2650
01:59:14,875 --> 01:59:18,588
That matters too, but
nowhere close to the stuff

2651
01:59:18,588 --> 01:59:21,065
we were talking about earlier.

2652
01:59:21,065 --> 01:59:22,516
So, I appreciate it.

2653
01:59:22,516 --> 01:59:24,274
- [Michael] No worries, and,

2654
01:59:24,274 --> 01:59:27,229
I've got on my phone the You're Gonna Die,

2655
01:59:27,229 --> 01:59:29,084
it's a very hard one to
explain to the kids sometimes,

2656
01:59:29,084 --> 01:59:30,652
though, when they see it.

2657
01:59:30,652 --> 01:59:31,847
- It's powerful, right?

2658
01:59:31,847 --> 01:59:33,315
- [Michael] Yeah, oh, it is, it is, yes.

2659
01:59:33,315 --> 01:59:35,548
- It's, I don't know what
everybody here is thinking,

2660
01:59:35,548 --> 01:59:37,231
the reason that lovely lady in the back

2661
01:59:37,231 --> 01:59:39,236
with the tech product, right,

2662
01:59:39,236 --> 01:59:42,299
I'd rather her fail on her tech product

2663
01:59:42,299 --> 01:59:45,154
than regret never doing it,

2664
01:59:45,154 --> 01:59:48,374
because the regret is gonna eat her alive.

2665
01:59:48,374 --> 01:59:50,275
And that's why I think about
you're gonna die, like,

2666
01:59:50,275 --> 01:59:52,179
I don't know what you guys are thinking,

2667
01:59:52,179 --> 01:59:53,891
but whatever the hell you wanna do,

2668
01:59:53,891 --> 01:59:55,835
I highly recommend you do it,

2669
01:59:55,835 --> 01:59:59,075
because if you spend time
with old people like I do,

2670
01:59:59,075 --> 02:00:00,786
you will figure out real fast,

2671
02:00:00,786 --> 02:00:03,797
it is your biggest vulnerability.

2672
02:00:03,797 --> 02:00:05,911
It will be the thing that kills you

2673
02:00:05,911 --> 02:00:09,538
when you can't do anything about it.

2674
02:00:09,538 --> 02:00:11,468
Regret is scary.

2675
02:00:11,468 --> 02:00:13,551
It's as scary as it gets.

2676
02:00:14,504 --> 02:00:16,451
- [Michael] Is it okay to get a Perth crew

2677
02:00:16,451 --> 02:00:18,885
kind of selfie with the
three of us and yourself?

2678
02:00:18,885 --> 02:00:19,945
- Sure.

2679
02:00:19,945 --> 02:00:21,572
- Cool, thank you.
- Cool.

2680
02:00:21,572 --> 02:00:23,739
One more, are we done, or?

2681
02:00:25,366 --> 02:00:26,748
- [Jack] Hi, Gary.

2682
02:00:26,748 --> 02:00:27,770
- How are you?

2683
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:31,516
- [Jack] I'm fine, I'm Jack
from Take Charge dot Asia,

2684
02:00:31,516 --> 02:00:35,603
so, we actually very
passionate on education.

2685
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:37,578
So, I would like to get your view,

2686
02:00:37,578 --> 02:00:40,630
how do you see we can evolve the education

2687
02:00:40,630 --> 02:00:44,041
from now to it's, to the future.

2688
02:00:44,041 --> 02:00:45,983
- [Gary] You got it, so, one more time,

2689
02:00:45,983 --> 02:00:49,095
the education is what, one more time?

2690
02:00:49,095 --> 02:00:52,428
- [Jack] How do we evolve the education?

2691
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:57,345
- Which education, what kind of education?

2692
02:00:57,345 --> 02:00:59,793
- [Jack] Higher education.
- Higher education.

2693
02:00:59,793 --> 02:01:03,014
So, I think higher education
is in a very vulnerable place,

2694
02:01:03,014 --> 02:01:04,845
because I think most
people in higher education

2695
02:01:04,845 --> 02:01:06,746
don't understand that the only thing

2696
02:01:06,746 --> 02:01:09,407
they're trading on is brand,

2697
02:01:09,407 --> 02:01:10,961
and as we start seeing
the biggest and best

2698
02:01:10,961 --> 02:01:13,352
universities in the world start creating

2699
02:01:13,352 --> 02:01:17,085
these products that are
diluting their brand,

2700
02:01:17,085 --> 02:01:19,154
right, which we're seeing a lot of now,

2701
02:01:19,154 --> 02:01:21,196
Stanford and Harvard selling courses where

2702
02:01:21,196 --> 02:01:23,204
people can say on
LinkedIn they went there,

2703
02:01:23,204 --> 02:01:24,987
even though they took a course.

2704
02:01:24,987 --> 02:01:27,970
I think the way higher
education is gonna evolve

2705
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:30,420
is the professors
themselves are gonna start

2706
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:34,746
getting huge leverage to
go direct to consumer,

2707
02:01:34,746 --> 02:01:37,021
and start trading in that way.

2708
02:01:37,021 --> 02:01:41,975
So, I think, if you have
passion for the institution,

2709
02:01:41,975 --> 02:01:44,308
versus the actual education,

2710
02:01:45,541 --> 02:01:48,945
the money making entity
known as a university,

2711
02:01:48,945 --> 02:01:52,139
well, then I would change the
business model very quickly,

2712
02:01:52,139 --> 02:01:54,402
because it's got a real vulnerability

2713
02:01:54,402 --> 02:01:56,501
over the next decade because

2714
02:01:56,501 --> 02:01:59,799
of the decentralization
of information, right?

2715
02:01:59,799 --> 02:02:02,594
So, I guess my question is,

2716
02:02:02,594 --> 02:02:05,628
is your passion lie in
the university itself

2717
02:02:05,628 --> 02:02:10,424
being successful or education
itself being successful?

2718
02:02:10,424 --> 02:02:13,836
- [Jack] It's actually the 100
years old education system,

2719
02:02:13,836 --> 02:02:18,003
we want to make a change,
even we are small, yeah.

2720
02:02:19,147 --> 02:02:20,730
- For what purpose?

2721
02:02:22,805 --> 02:02:25,901
- [Jack] I just feel that
the youth, or the millennial,

2722
02:02:25,901 --> 02:02:30,090
they just somehow need
some guidance along the way

2723
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:33,198
to actually discover
what they desire in life.

2724
02:02:33,198 --> 02:02:35,347
- And you feel that modern universities

2725
02:02:35,347 --> 02:02:37,304
and intuitions are good at that?

2726
02:02:37,304 --> 02:02:38,153
- [Jack] No.

2727
02:02:38,153 --> 02:02:39,551
- Right, so,

2728
02:02:39,551 --> 02:02:40,384
so,

2729
02:02:41,248 --> 02:02:43,523
do you think it has anything
to do with the financial

2730
02:02:43,523 --> 02:02:46,106
benefits of being a university?

2731
02:02:49,915 --> 02:02:52,161
Because that's the question, right?

2732
02:02:52,161 --> 02:02:55,661
I think we all agree that this notion that

2733
02:02:56,754 --> 02:02:59,482
four years at university is becoming

2734
02:02:59,482 --> 02:03:01,537
this amazing guiding light for millennials

2735
02:03:01,537 --> 02:03:03,678
to find what they're passionate about

2736
02:03:03,678 --> 02:03:07,938
has 100 years of being
proven to not be true.

2737
02:03:07,938 --> 02:03:10,315
So, my question becomes,

2738
02:03:10,315 --> 02:03:13,657
with higher education,
is what's the purpose?

2739
02:03:13,657 --> 02:03:17,328
I default into the
purpose is to make money.

2740
02:03:17,328 --> 02:03:20,177
Which is not in the vested
interest of the user,

2741
02:03:20,177 --> 02:03:22,555
which is a vulnerable model.

2742
02:03:22,555 --> 02:03:27,019
If your passion is to help young
people find their passions,

2743
02:03:27,019 --> 02:03:30,113
I have a funny feeling
your default wouldn't be

2744
02:03:30,113 --> 02:03:34,280
into saving the institutions
known as universities.

2745
02:03:36,806 --> 02:03:40,997
Now, that's the interesting debate, right?

2746
02:03:40,997 --> 02:03:41,997
I feel that,

2747
02:03:43,103 --> 02:03:45,963
unfortunately, universities
have manifested

2748
02:03:45,963 --> 02:03:49,333
into incredibly self-serving machines,

2749
02:03:49,333 --> 02:03:52,917
and they're so broken that
I've gone so on the other side,

2750
02:03:52,917 --> 02:03:54,572
and I can't speak to
other parts of the world,

2751
02:03:54,572 --> 02:03:58,386
but in America, they've become
the worst thing on Earth.

2752
02:03:58,386 --> 02:04:01,239
Kids are getting
unbelievable amounts of debt

2753
02:04:01,239 --> 02:04:03,171
that they can't get out of,

2754
02:04:03,171 --> 02:04:06,182
and aren't being put in
a position to recoup it

2755
02:04:06,182 --> 02:04:09,747
within the first 20 years
of them being out of it.

2756
02:04:09,747 --> 02:04:12,597
Now, I know there's other
rules in other places,

2757
02:04:12,597 --> 02:04:15,259
so, I know a lot of us
are from different places,

2758
02:04:15,259 --> 02:04:17,092
but if you're,

2759
02:04:17,092 --> 02:04:20,937
if you're telling me your
passion is to help kids

2760
02:04:20,937 --> 02:04:25,685
find their passions, I would
use a blank piece of paper,

2761
02:04:25,685 --> 02:04:27,643
and reinvent a new model,

2762
02:04:27,643 --> 02:04:30,796
I have a funny feeling that
whatever you come up with

2763
02:04:30,796 --> 02:04:32,608
is not gonna be something
that the traditional

2764
02:04:32,608 --> 02:04:34,465
universities are gonna like,

2765
02:04:34,465 --> 02:04:36,685
because it's gonna break
their financial system.

2766
02:04:36,685 --> 02:04:38,038
- [Jack] Yes, exactly.

2767
02:04:38,038 --> 02:04:39,937
- So, now the question is,

2768
02:04:39,937 --> 02:04:42,703
do you wanna find a new business model

2769
02:04:42,703 --> 02:04:45,420
for a traditional institution
because that's what

2770
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:47,487
you do for a living right now,

2771
02:04:47,487 --> 02:04:50,809
or do you wanna go on a quest
to reinvent the opportunity,

2772
02:04:50,809 --> 02:04:53,010
those are two very different things.

2773
02:04:53,010 --> 02:04:54,998
- Quest to reinvent.
- Good.

2774
02:04:54,998 --> 02:04:59,159
So, I'm an investor in a
startup called MissionU,

2775
02:04:59,159 --> 02:05:03,831
which is a different business
model where they educate,

2776
02:05:03,831 --> 02:05:05,498
right, and for free,

2777
02:05:07,078 --> 02:05:11,245
but in return, the students
give 15% of their salary

2778
02:05:12,705 --> 02:05:15,872
the first three years of their career.

2779
02:05:16,718 --> 02:05:18,564
I think what Adam's doing there is trying

2780
02:05:18,564 --> 02:05:21,572
to rethink the way this is all played out.

2781
02:05:21,572 --> 02:05:23,939
But I still think it's
self-serving interest, right,

2782
02:05:23,939 --> 02:05:25,904
produce people that, if
you think about that model,

2783
02:05:25,904 --> 02:05:28,049
produce people that will
actually make money,

2784
02:05:28,049 --> 02:05:30,738
so that I can get back my 15%.

2785
02:05:30,738 --> 02:05:32,927
You know, I question the whole thing.

2786
02:05:32,927 --> 02:05:34,687
Now, I question the whole thing 'cause

2787
02:05:34,687 --> 02:05:36,441
I was a terrible student,

2788
02:05:36,441 --> 02:05:40,247
I was super self-aware of who I was.

2789
02:05:40,247 --> 02:05:43,442
I would tell you, if you
really wanna achieve your goal,

2790
02:05:43,442 --> 02:05:46,808
you need to create a model that
gets to six to 10 year olds,

2791
02:05:46,808 --> 02:05:49,630
and you start finding a way
to teach self-awareness.

2792
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:53,526
If you can figure that out,
you will achieve your goal.

2793
02:05:53,526 --> 02:05:54,684
- [Jack] Okay.

2794
02:05:54,684 --> 02:05:55,690
Thank you, Gary.

2795
02:05:55,690 --> 02:05:57,107
- You're welcome.

2796
02:05:59,176 --> 02:06:00,816
I'll go more.

2797
02:06:00,816 --> 02:06:03,368
- [Man] Okay, but, you
know, maybe you know this,

2798
02:06:03,368 --> 02:06:04,972
all these guys want to
have a picture with you.

2799
02:06:04,972 --> 02:06:07,080
- Listen, I'll stand here
until tomorrow and just leave,

2800
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:08,503
and then.
- No, no, no,

2801
02:06:08,503 --> 02:06:11,156
all these guys want to
have a picture with you.

2802
02:06:11,156 --> 02:06:13,242
- Yeah, but if, you're in charge, not me,

2803
02:06:13,242 --> 02:06:14,728
I'm, I'm just.
- Okay, so.

2804
02:06:14,728 --> 02:06:15,728
Do your job.

2805
02:06:16,732 --> 02:06:18,842
- So, which one do you want me to do?

2806
02:06:18,842 --> 02:06:20,036
Okay, good, hello.

2807
02:06:20,036 --> 02:06:21,173
- [Woman] Hi Gary, hi Gary.

2808
02:06:21,173 --> 02:06:22,006
- Hi.

2809
02:06:22,006 --> 02:06:23,452
- [Woman] Okay, in every businesses,

2810
02:06:23,452 --> 02:06:26,502
there's the supply and the demand side.

2811
02:06:26,502 --> 02:06:27,938
- The most interesting thing

2812
02:06:27,938 --> 02:06:30,217
that I've heard somebody
say in a long time,

2813
02:06:30,217 --> 02:06:32,090
'cause you're 100% right,

2814
02:06:32,090 --> 02:06:35,947
and it blows my mind that
almost nobody talks about it.

2815
02:06:35,947 --> 02:06:38,248
- [Woman] Okay, so, here's my issue.

2816
02:06:38,248 --> 02:06:40,869
I don't have any problem
with the demand portion.

2817
02:06:40,869 --> 02:06:42,609
Okay, the minute I go out there,

2818
02:06:42,609 --> 02:06:46,128
I open my mouth, I'll get the business.

2819
02:06:46,128 --> 02:06:47,669
- You don't know how to fill the pipe.

2820
02:06:47,669 --> 02:06:51,495
- [Woman] Yes, and I don't
know how to duplicate myself.

2821
02:06:51,495 --> 02:06:53,050
- Because you can't.
- I can't!

2822
02:06:53,050 --> 02:06:55,369
- I don't know if you heard.

2823
02:06:55,369 --> 02:06:56,202
(audience laughing)

2824
02:06:56,202 --> 02:06:57,900
- [Woman] Yes, I know that, but I need to,

2825
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:00,896
I really, really need
to automate my business

2826
02:07:00,896 --> 02:07:01,892
and duplicate myself,

2827
02:07:01,892 --> 02:07:03,618
so that I can go home and have a holiday!

2828
02:07:03,618 --> 02:07:06,180
- I understand.
- So, what, do you.

2829
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:08,901
- There's only two
things holding you back.

2830
02:07:08,901 --> 02:07:12,428
Your inability to operate, or your ego.

2831
02:07:12,428 --> 02:07:15,870
So we just have to dissect
it with a couple questions.

2832
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:17,959
What do you sell?

2833
02:07:17,959 --> 02:07:20,407
- I'm in consulting.
- Great.

2834
02:07:20,407 --> 02:07:22,699
Why haven't you hired
more people to consult?

2835
02:07:22,699 --> 02:07:23,910
- I have.
- Good.

2836
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:25,442
- [Woman] But they're just not up to it.

2837
02:07:25,442 --> 02:07:27,058
They're just not up to the level,

2838
02:07:27,058 --> 02:07:29,446
they're not, and--
- Hold on, hold on.

2839
02:07:29,446 --> 02:07:32,561
Up to whose level, yours or the clients'?

2840
02:07:32,561 --> 02:07:34,915
- [Woman] The level that I set as a basis

2841
02:07:34,915 --> 02:07:38,804
to benchmark as what I go
for, it's money service.

2842
02:07:38,804 --> 02:07:40,971
- So, so, you, real quick,

2843
02:07:42,645 --> 02:07:44,708
who's hiring these people?

2844
02:07:44,708 --> 02:07:45,556
- [Woman] Me.

2845
02:07:45,556 --> 02:07:48,237
- Okay, so let's play this game together.

2846
02:07:48,237 --> 02:07:49,875
(audience laughing)

2847
02:07:49,875 --> 02:07:50,957
- [Woman] Alright.

2848
02:07:50,957 --> 02:07:52,370
- What's about to happen is you're about

2849
02:07:52,370 --> 02:07:56,744
to get exposed to yourself,
and then you'll be able to win.

2850
02:07:56,744 --> 02:07:58,659
You're playing the very fun game

2851
02:07:58,659 --> 02:08:01,326
of you've got a big fucking ego.

2852
02:08:02,608 --> 02:08:03,816
I mean it.

2853
02:08:03,816 --> 02:08:05,645
You've gotta wrap your head around this.

2854
02:08:05,645 --> 02:08:08,484
You're hiring, you've created an arbitrary

2855
02:08:08,484 --> 02:08:10,901
benchmark that nobody's hitting

2856
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:13,591
because you have put
yourself on a pedestal

2857
02:08:13,591 --> 02:08:16,068
at the mercy and the detriment

2858
02:08:16,068 --> 02:08:18,328
of building a bigger business,

2859
02:08:18,328 --> 02:08:22,495
because you wanna self-fulfill
that you're so much better.

2860
02:08:25,722 --> 02:08:26,805
Play with me.

2861
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:31,881
You can't, think about what you, go ahead.

2862
02:08:31,881 --> 02:08:33,856
- [Woman] I'm not willing
to lower my standards.

2863
02:08:33,856 --> 02:08:36,047
- So don't, don't scale, then.

2864
02:08:36,047 --> 02:08:37,714
Be a one woman show.

2865
02:08:40,005 --> 02:08:41,673
- [Woman] I believe I can do more,

2866
02:08:41,673 --> 02:08:44,121
I believe we should duplicate this.

2867
02:08:44,121 --> 02:08:47,320
I mean, I've got the models,
I've got everything there.

2868
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:50,734
I've basically templated
everything that I do.

2869
02:08:50,734 --> 02:08:53,493
So, all you need to do
is take the template,

2870
02:08:53,493 --> 02:08:58,389
follow the SOP, and let's
go out, hit the market.

2871
02:08:58,389 --> 02:09:01,180
- How many employees have
you had at the height?

2872
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:02,260
- [Woman] 12.

2873
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:03,581
- And how many do you have now?

2874
02:09:03,581 --> 02:09:04,748
- [Woman] Two.

2875
02:09:05,745 --> 02:09:08,166
- And was it customers firing or,

2876
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:09,488
them?
- Me.

2877
02:09:09,488 --> 02:09:10,321
- You.

2878
02:09:10,321 --> 02:09:14,268
- [Woman] And at one point,
early this year, everyone left,

2879
02:09:14,268 --> 02:09:16,702
and I'm fine with that.
- Why?

2880
02:09:16,702 --> 02:09:18,516
- [Woman] Because they realized that it

2881
02:09:18,516 --> 02:09:20,389
was the wrong place for them to be.

2882
02:09:20,389 --> 02:09:22,589
And I realized that I can't,

2883
02:09:22,589 --> 02:09:24,796
there's no point for me to keep anyone

2884
02:09:24,796 --> 02:09:28,648
when they can't do the
job, and I'm, I'm prepared.

2885
02:09:28,648 --> 02:09:31,535
- Have you thought about the possibility

2886
02:09:31,535 --> 02:09:35,702
of you being a great
consultant but a terrible boss?

2887
02:09:37,033 --> 02:09:38,642
I'm asking, I'm asking.

2888
02:09:38,642 --> 02:09:40,961
- [Woman] I have that reputation, I know.

2889
02:09:40,961 --> 02:09:41,796
- Okay.

2890
02:09:41,796 --> 02:09:43,027
(audience laughing)

2891
02:09:43,027 --> 02:09:45,608
So, thanks for answering.

2892
02:09:45,608 --> 02:09:48,288
Look, I think you have,
I'm being serious with you,

2893
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:51,213
and the reason I went right
at it, I want you to win.

2894
02:09:51,213 --> 02:09:54,251
It's a game of ego, and
what people don't understand

2895
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:56,413
is that is the problem for all the,

2896
02:09:56,413 --> 02:09:59,302
the reason I've been able
to scale VaynerMedia,

2897
02:09:59,302 --> 02:10:02,111
many think that I have an
ego, I play on confidence,

2898
02:10:02,111 --> 02:10:04,731
which is what allows me to scale,

2899
02:10:04,731 --> 02:10:07,165
because I don't hold
everybody to an arbitrary

2900
02:10:07,165 --> 02:10:10,476
metric that has no reality other than

2901
02:10:10,476 --> 02:10:12,976
what's playing in my own head.

2902
02:10:15,139 --> 02:10:17,806
To me, if you're the one firing,

2903
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:21,371
or they're quitting 'cause
the work environment

2904
02:10:21,371 --> 02:10:25,018
is exhausting because you
keep pounding the drum

2905
02:10:25,018 --> 02:10:28,601
of some fake Mendoza
line of quality needed

2906
02:10:29,711 --> 02:10:32,553
that you are the judge and jury of,

2907
02:10:32,553 --> 02:10:35,238
and it's some interpretation
of how you decide

2908
02:10:35,238 --> 02:10:37,818
they follow the template,

2909
02:10:37,818 --> 02:10:41,027
you're just scratching your
own ego of how great you are

2910
02:10:41,027 --> 02:10:43,097
at the detriment of your business.

2911
02:10:43,097 --> 02:10:46,196
The reason I have 800
employees and high retention

2912
02:10:46,196 --> 02:10:49,091
is I don't hold any of
them to my standard,

2913
02:10:49,091 --> 02:10:50,752
because they don't need to be me

2914
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:52,413
to build an actual business.

2915
02:10:52,413 --> 02:10:54,718
You need to decide if you wanna build

2916
02:10:54,718 --> 02:10:57,968
a one woman shop or an actual business.

2917
02:11:04,151 --> 02:11:05,891
And can I tell you something?

2918
02:11:05,891 --> 02:11:08,396
There's nothing wrong
with the one woman shop.

2919
02:11:08,396 --> 02:11:11,433
The way you'll scale is
you may charge for content,

2920
02:11:11,433 --> 02:11:12,343
you may write a book,

2921
02:11:12,343 --> 02:11:13,967
you may start getting paid more to speak.

2922
02:11:13,967 --> 02:11:15,897
You don't, maybe you don't,
you know what I mean?

2923
02:11:15,897 --> 02:11:18,000
And even when I say it,
when I see you react,

2924
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,100
you don't need to build a
40 person consulting shop,

2925
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:22,531
because maybe you don't like it.

2926
02:11:22,531 --> 02:11:24,108
It's not that you're a bad person,

2927
02:11:24,108 --> 02:11:26,219
it's that you don't wanna
lower your standards,

2928
02:11:26,219 --> 02:11:28,941
and if you're stuck in that,

2929
02:11:28,941 --> 02:11:30,755
well, then monetize a different way

2930
02:11:30,755 --> 02:11:33,764
by expanding more around you,

2931
02:11:33,764 --> 02:11:36,919
versus trying to build up the
actual business around it.

2932
02:11:36,919 --> 02:11:38,771
You know what I mean, and that's okay,

2933
02:11:38,771 --> 02:11:40,514
it doesn't make you a bad person,

2934
02:11:40,514 --> 02:11:42,484
as a matter of fact, you'll
probably be disproportionately

2935
02:11:42,484 --> 02:11:44,862
more successful, 'cause
you're being self-aware,

2936
02:11:44,862 --> 02:11:47,080
and enjoying being the one person band

2937
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:48,966
and making your money that way.

2938
02:11:48,966 --> 02:11:50,854
You don't have to build VaynerMedia,

2939
02:11:50,854 --> 02:11:52,436
you don't have to build Bain and McKinsey,

2940
02:11:52,436 --> 02:11:56,603
be you, and be your best
self your way, and enjoy it.

2941
02:12:01,589 --> 02:12:03,289
- [Woman] Thank you.

2942
02:12:03,289 --> 02:12:04,706
- You're welcome.

2943
02:12:09,071 --> 02:12:13,238
- [Rayson] Would you mind,
would you help me video this?

2944
02:12:15,006 --> 02:12:16,604
Hi, Gary.
- How are you?

2945
02:12:16,604 --> 02:12:19,638
- [Rayson] I am doing
great, my name is Rayson,

2946
02:12:19,638 --> 02:12:23,686
and I'm actually a
psychiatric nurse in practice,

2947
02:12:23,686 --> 02:12:27,516
and also a founder of
this brand called Raygacy,

2948
02:12:27,516 --> 02:12:31,706
because Raygacy means Rayson's legacy, so,

2949
02:12:31,706 --> 02:12:33,384
I wanna create my own legacy.

2950
02:12:33,384 --> 02:12:37,051
So, now that, now that
I'm actually in doing

2951
02:12:38,423 --> 02:12:41,155
freelance coaching,
training, and speaking,

2952
02:12:41,155 --> 02:12:44,358
motivational speaking, I
would like to actually ask you

2953
02:12:44,358 --> 02:12:48,129
if you and me, within the
next two to three years,

2954
02:12:48,129 --> 02:12:50,796
because I plan to leave nursing,

2955
02:12:52,358 --> 02:12:55,910
because I find that I
have a lot of potential,

2956
02:12:55,910 --> 02:12:58,634
and I believe I can do even more,

2957
02:12:58,634 --> 02:13:00,707
not just helping the mentally ill,

2958
02:13:00,707 --> 02:13:03,930
and even my mother, who
suffers from schizophrenia,

2959
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:07,572
I want to help people around
and impact lives, as well,

2960
02:13:07,572 --> 02:13:11,114
inspire them, what would you suggest,

2961
02:13:11,114 --> 02:13:15,159
or what would you do if
you were in my position?

2962
02:13:15,159 --> 02:13:17,145
- And you wanna leave
in two or three years.

2963
02:13:17,145 --> 02:13:18,255
- [Rayson] Yes.

2964
02:13:18,255 --> 02:13:19,650
- I would save money.

2965
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:20,715
- [Rayson] Save money.

2966
02:13:20,715 --> 02:13:21,872
- Save money.

2967
02:13:21,872 --> 02:13:26,039
And produce content to create
awareness for when you leave,

2968
02:13:27,769 --> 02:13:30,828
and I wouldn't spend money on dumb stuff,

2969
02:13:30,828 --> 02:13:32,509
because when you go make that jump,

2970
02:13:32,509 --> 02:13:37,046
you wanna be in the most safe
place financially, right?

2971
02:13:37,046 --> 02:13:40,688
So, I would save money
and produce content.

2972
02:13:40,688 --> 02:13:43,089
- [Rayson] I have been producing content,

2973
02:13:43,089 --> 02:13:46,131
which is what I call the Raygacy Show,

2974
02:13:46,131 --> 02:13:49,645
so the Raygacy Show is
actually where I interview

2975
02:13:49,645 --> 02:13:53,698
entrepreneurs, successful
entrepreneurs, actors even,

2976
02:13:53,698 --> 02:13:57,781
even just now I actually
interviewed a chef, as well,

2977
02:13:57,781 --> 02:14:00,690
and I interview a lot of people.

2978
02:14:00,690 --> 02:14:03,319
I already have done only
11 episodes for now,

2979
02:14:03,319 --> 02:14:05,466
but I am doing more,

2980
02:14:05,466 --> 02:14:08,962
because I'm actually using
Facebook Live to do it,

2981
02:14:08,962 --> 02:14:12,461
because I feel that Facebook
Live has always been

2982
02:14:12,461 --> 02:14:15,542
a negative component where
people actually use it

2983
02:14:15,542 --> 02:14:18,404
to see people jumping down, or accidents,

2984
02:14:18,404 --> 02:14:21,128
and stuff like that, so I
wanted to use it as a value,

2985
02:14:21,128 --> 02:14:24,424
adding content, so I use
it, and then after that,

2986
02:14:24,424 --> 02:14:27,145
I convert it to YouTube
and then I will share it

2987
02:14:27,145 --> 02:14:29,406
on YouTube and let people watch, as well.

2988
02:14:29,406 --> 02:14:32,530
So, yeah, so, this is
the thing that I'm doing,

2989
02:14:32,530 --> 02:14:35,105
and one thing is I want
to actually scale it up.

2990
02:14:35,105 --> 02:14:37,208
I want to have more people to watch it,

2991
02:14:37,208 --> 02:14:39,875
I want to have more viewers and.

2992
02:14:41,415 --> 02:14:44,133
- Well, there's two things you have to do.

2993
02:14:44,133 --> 02:14:47,550
Make more shows, and be more interesting.

2994
02:14:49,466 --> 02:14:50,913
Because, don't forget,

2995
02:14:50,913 --> 02:14:53,176
you're doing something
very interesting to me.

2996
02:14:53,176 --> 02:14:54,774
You said that you have the potential

2997
02:14:54,774 --> 02:14:57,223
to be very motivational,
that you wanna help people,

2998
02:14:57,223 --> 02:14:59,053
this, that, the other thing,

2999
02:14:59,053 --> 02:15:01,887
but then your first execution in media

3000
02:15:01,887 --> 02:15:05,054
is to trade off other people's equity.

3001
02:15:07,557 --> 02:15:10,192
It's an insight, there's
nothing wrong with it.

3002
02:15:10,192 --> 02:15:12,249
No different than the
last conversation we had.

3003
02:15:12,249 --> 02:15:15,663
There's nothing wrong with
anything if you have good intent,

3004
02:15:15,663 --> 02:15:19,195
but you have to be
thoughtful and ask yourself,

3005
02:15:19,195 --> 02:15:22,516
if you have so much potential
to be so motivational

3006
02:15:22,516 --> 02:15:25,239
and bring value, why
did you go down the path

3007
02:15:25,239 --> 02:15:29,584
of having guests, which is
always the quickest tell

3008
02:15:29,584 --> 02:15:33,084
to needing something else to drive content

3009
02:15:34,398 --> 02:15:37,674
versus just being on yourself and up here.

3010
02:15:37,674 --> 02:15:40,766
And it's important for you
to be honest with yourself.

3011
02:15:40,766 --> 02:15:42,909
Maybe you're trying to get
your legs underneath you,

3012
02:15:42,909 --> 02:15:46,166
there's nothing wrong with it,

3013
02:15:46,166 --> 02:15:48,950
but the way you framed it up,

3014
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:52,070
where you converted your name into legacy,

3015
02:15:52,070 --> 02:15:55,009
and your first move is to
interview other people,

3016
02:15:55,009 --> 02:15:57,530
which is the real driver of it, you have,

3017
02:15:57,530 --> 02:16:00,132
the first thing I would say is do not jump

3018
02:16:00,132 --> 02:16:01,702
until you're ready at a place where you

3019
02:16:01,702 --> 02:16:04,566
can command an audience by yourself

3020
02:16:04,566 --> 02:16:07,392
without leveraging somebody else.

3021
02:16:07,392 --> 02:16:09,374
The reason I knew that I was gonna win

3022
02:16:09,374 --> 02:16:12,171
in business content in podcast,

3023
02:16:12,171 --> 02:16:16,338
was 99% of podcasts were people
interviewing other people,

3024
02:16:17,337 --> 02:16:20,160
which means the host is the commodity

3025
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,327
and the guest is the draw.

3026
02:16:26,164 --> 02:16:27,919
There's so many subtleties in everything

3027
02:16:27,919 --> 02:16:29,919
that we're doing here.

3028
02:16:29,919 --> 02:16:31,186
You gotta look for them,

3029
02:16:31,186 --> 02:16:32,860
because they're really interesting tells

3030
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:35,877
to what's really going on, right?

3031
02:16:35,877 --> 02:16:37,964
Like the last wonderful,
the lady next to you,

3032
02:16:37,964 --> 02:16:40,068
but I'm excited, to me,
that's gonna be the thing

3033
02:16:40,068 --> 02:16:41,422
I think about on the flight, I'm like,

3034
02:16:41,423 --> 02:16:42,719
I think she's gonna win.

3035
02:16:42,719 --> 02:16:44,244
You have to get to that
place where you realize

3036
02:16:44,245 --> 02:16:46,709
if you're the one making the rules

3037
02:16:46,709 --> 02:16:50,118
and nobody can hit it, that
needs to be thought about.

3038
02:16:50,119 --> 02:16:51,588
What does that mean?

3039
02:16:51,588 --> 02:16:54,005
Same for you, if you're
gonna make that jump,

3040
02:16:54,005 --> 02:16:55,575
especially when you have the audacity

3041
02:16:55,575 --> 02:16:57,243
to convert your name into legacy.

3042
02:16:57,244 --> 02:16:59,091
(audience laughing)

3043
02:16:59,091 --> 02:17:01,151
That you need to be good
enough before you jump

3044
02:17:01,151 --> 02:17:05,407
into not being at the
mercy of somebody else.

3045
02:17:05,407 --> 02:17:07,150
- [Grayson] Okay, okay, thank you.

3046
02:17:07,151 --> 02:17:07,984
- You're welcome.

3047
02:17:07,984 --> 02:17:09,186
- [Grayson] Do you mind if
I have a photo with you?

3048
02:17:09,186 --> 02:17:10,769
- Sure.
- Thank you.

3049
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:15,657
- Last one?

3050
02:17:18,223 --> 02:17:19,492
- [Man] Gary, I would just wanna get

3051
02:17:19,492 --> 02:17:21,392
as close as possible because
I still can't believe

3052
02:17:21,392 --> 02:17:22,991
I'm talking to you.
- Thank you.

3053
02:17:22,991 --> 02:17:26,973
- [Man] Okay, and this is
the last question, guys.

3054
02:17:26,973 --> 02:17:28,713
- Sure, I got you.

3055
02:17:28,713 --> 02:17:31,074
- [Man] Gary, you talk a
lot about self-awareness.

3056
02:17:31,074 --> 02:17:32,272
- Also, if you're gonna go for legacy,

3057
02:17:32,272 --> 02:17:34,915
you're gonna have to
learn how to take selfies.

3058
02:17:34,915 --> 02:17:35,998
Just kidding.

3059
02:17:40,009 --> 02:17:42,342
Awesome, thank you, my
friend, good luck to you.

3060
02:17:42,342 --> 02:17:43,635
Yes, sir.

3061
02:17:43,635 --> 02:17:45,932
- [Man] Gary, among all the
things that you talk about,

3062
02:17:45,932 --> 02:17:48,433
being branding, marketing,
and all of that,

3063
02:17:48,433 --> 02:17:51,252
the thing which hits me hard
the most is self-awareness,

3064
02:17:51,252 --> 02:17:53,209
because you always talk
about self-awareness,

3065
02:17:53,209 --> 02:17:55,326
and the reason why that's so is because

3066
02:17:55,326 --> 02:17:59,085
I've got a brother who was
born with cerebral palsy.

3067
02:17:59,085 --> 02:18:01,616
He was born with cerebral
palsy, he was a breech baby,

3068
02:18:01,617 --> 02:18:03,585
and doctors said that he wouldn't be able

3069
02:18:03,585 --> 02:18:05,834
to live for more than 24 hours.

3070
02:18:05,834 --> 02:18:09,278
But then, he's gone on, he's
achieved some good things,

3071
02:18:09,279 --> 02:18:13,205
he's even written a book that's
titled Better Than Normal,

3072
02:18:13,205 --> 02:18:15,450
it's the t-shirt that I'm wearing,

3073
02:18:15,450 --> 02:18:17,797
and he wants to become a speaker,

3074
02:18:17,798 --> 02:18:20,391
he wants to go on and inspire life,

3075
02:18:20,391 --> 02:18:23,950
our big mission to, our dream
is to inspire 50 million

3076
02:18:23,950 --> 02:18:27,533
people by 2050, and
coming to the question,

3077
02:18:29,117 --> 02:18:31,566
do you think, because
you are super successful,

3078
02:18:31,566 --> 02:18:34,643
you're a super successful entrepreneur,

3079
02:18:34,643 --> 02:18:36,572
everything that you are,
we all wanna be you,

3080
02:18:36,572 --> 02:18:38,082
I wanna be you.

3081
02:18:38,082 --> 02:18:40,521
Do you think you would
have been this successful

3082
02:18:40,521 --> 02:18:43,151
if you were born with
some kind of disability,

3083
02:18:43,151 --> 02:18:45,964
or if you were born, I know
you had some disadvantages

3084
02:18:45,964 --> 02:18:47,888
in your life, but do you
think you would have been

3085
02:18:47,888 --> 02:18:51,072
this successful if you were
born with a disability,

3086
02:18:51,072 --> 02:18:53,258
something that you cannot
change about yourself,

3087
02:18:53,258 --> 02:18:54,437
something physical.
- I don't know.

3088
02:18:54,437 --> 02:18:55,883
I don't know.

3089
02:18:55,883 --> 02:18:59,089
I think it would be crazy for
me to answer that question.

3090
02:18:59,089 --> 02:19:00,807
Here's what I would say.

3091
02:19:00,807 --> 02:19:04,974
I think that disadvantages
are the ultimate advantage.

3092
02:19:05,816 --> 02:19:09,066
I think adversity is a
humongous advantage in life,

3093
02:19:09,066 --> 02:19:12,035
but when you go into real diseases or

3094
02:19:12,035 --> 02:19:14,495
things that could create
huge insecurities,

3095
02:19:14,495 --> 02:19:17,770
if you're born without an eye, as a child,

3096
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:21,867
having a glass eye could
have created such a complex

3097
02:19:21,867 --> 02:19:24,749
that maybe the confidence
would have never been there.

3098
02:19:24,749 --> 02:19:29,036
So, I think it's crazy for
me to even take a stab at

3099
02:19:29,036 --> 02:19:31,772
judging what would have been.

3100
02:19:31,772 --> 02:19:33,822
I think that would be inappropriate.

3101
02:19:33,822 --> 02:19:35,053
- [Man] And the reason why I say that,

3102
02:19:35,053 --> 02:19:37,760
because although our brand
is Better Than Normal,

3103
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,508
if you ask Hitesh, he's
not here today because

3104
02:19:39,508 --> 02:19:41,794
he's in India doing his
therapy and we are doing

3105
02:19:41,794 --> 02:19:44,199
a movement in India because
the market is bigger,

3106
02:19:44,199 --> 02:19:46,009
but he's gotta do
therapy every single day,

3107
02:19:46,009 --> 02:19:48,112
six to eight hours of
it just to maintain his,

3108
02:19:48,112 --> 02:19:51,021
just to maintain his state,
and if you ask Hitesh,

3109
02:19:51,021 --> 02:19:53,973
even though we want to
inspire 50 million by 2050

3110
02:19:53,973 --> 02:19:55,772
to become better than
normal, if you ask him,

3111
02:19:55,772 --> 02:19:57,916
Hitesh, before you die, what
is the one thing that you want,

3112
02:19:57,916 --> 02:20:00,926
the irony of it is that he will tell you

3113
02:20:00,926 --> 02:20:02,581
that he wants to be normal.

3114
02:20:02,581 --> 02:20:03,758
- Of course.

3115
02:20:03,758 --> 02:20:06,051
Because that's his truth.

3116
02:20:06,051 --> 02:20:09,217
You know, instead of some
arbitrary number of 50,

3117
02:20:09,217 --> 02:20:11,151
I mean, 50 million people in 2050

3118
02:20:11,151 --> 02:20:13,539
is an arbitrary thing
that you guys stumbled on

3119
02:20:13,539 --> 02:20:15,941
that has zero anything.

3120
02:20:15,941 --> 02:20:18,548
I think the, to me, I've
always thought about it as.

3121
02:20:18,548 --> 02:20:20,798
(clicking)

3122
02:20:21,774 --> 02:20:24,583
Best way to get to 50 million
is to focus at one at a time.

3123
02:20:24,583 --> 02:20:28,334
The second I hear 2050,
50, I'm like, finished.

3124
02:20:28,334 --> 02:20:29,597
Finished.

3125
02:20:29,597 --> 02:20:33,232
Right, like, so, that makes sense,

3126
02:20:33,232 --> 02:20:35,966
and I think it's super
awesome to see the love

3127
02:20:35,966 --> 02:20:37,584
you have for your brother,

3128
02:20:37,584 --> 02:20:39,325
I think, couple things.

3129
02:20:39,325 --> 02:20:41,658
You need to do me one favor.

3130
02:20:42,638 --> 02:20:45,525
A, have no interest in being me,

3131
02:20:45,525 --> 02:20:48,612
B, have no interest in
wrapping yourself up

3132
02:20:48,612 --> 02:20:50,556
in your brother's story,

3133
02:20:50,556 --> 02:20:53,200
because you're just
gonna end up resentful,

3134
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:54,404
and you need to,

3135
02:20:54,404 --> 02:20:56,960
ironically, you started
with self-awareness,

3136
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:58,545
you need to go inside yourself and really

3137
02:20:58,545 --> 02:21:00,303
figure out what you're doing here.

3138
02:21:00,303 --> 02:21:02,948
How much are you using
this for your own want,

3139
02:21:02,948 --> 02:21:05,556
how much are you doing this
for him, you need to get,

3140
02:21:05,556 --> 02:21:07,929
the way you structured all this,

3141
02:21:07,929 --> 02:21:10,739
this could get real bad real fast.

3142
02:21:10,739 --> 02:21:13,745
And so, I want you to promise
me to just be thoughtful,

3143
02:21:13,745 --> 02:21:17,305
because a lot of times,
it's the same way I see,

3144
02:21:17,305 --> 02:21:20,417
like, I spend a lot of
time in this dynamic,

3145
02:21:20,417 --> 02:21:22,917
you need to be careful.

3146
02:21:22,917 --> 02:21:25,455
- [Man] My main purpose
in my life I feel is

3147
02:21:25,455 --> 02:21:27,208
I want him to be independent,

3148
02:21:27,208 --> 02:21:28,689
physically, emotionally, mentally,

3149
02:21:28,689 --> 02:21:31,454
that's what I really want,
regardless of the brand,

3150
02:21:31,454 --> 02:21:32,937
regardless of whether we make any money,

3151
02:21:32,937 --> 02:21:34,694
I want him to be independent.

3152
02:21:34,694 --> 02:21:36,742
- If that's your number one.
- That's my number one.

3153
02:21:36,742 --> 02:21:38,262
- Then that has nothing to do with the way

3154
02:21:38,262 --> 02:21:43,178
you're positioning everything
that you're talking about.

3155
02:21:43,178 --> 02:21:44,849
There's nothing you said that even comes

3156
02:21:44,849 --> 02:21:47,682
remotely to mapping to that truth.

3157
02:21:48,545 --> 02:21:49,812
- [Man] I want him to know that,

3158
02:21:49,812 --> 02:21:53,194
I don't think he knows that,
that that's my number one.

3159
02:21:53,194 --> 02:21:54,397
- So, go tell him.

3160
02:21:54,397 --> 02:21:55,581
- [Man] I told him that a million times,

3161
02:21:55,581 --> 02:21:59,709
but he somehow believes that
it's not my responsibility

3162
02:21:59,709 --> 02:22:01,876
for him to be independent.

3163
02:22:02,928 --> 02:22:04,928
- That would make sense.

3164
02:22:06,053 --> 02:22:07,997
You need to be thoughtful.

3165
02:22:07,997 --> 02:22:12,603
Promise me, because this
scenario turns out bad a lot.

3166
02:22:12,603 --> 02:22:14,372
You end up with nothing.

3167
02:22:14,372 --> 02:22:17,844
Not your brother, not
the brand, just be smart.

3168
02:22:17,844 --> 02:22:19,541
- [Man] And I know you
don't read a lot of books,

3169
02:22:19,541 --> 02:22:21,253
and you've probably read
only four books in your life,

3170
02:22:21,253 --> 02:22:23,134
but I would just like
to give this one to you,

3171
02:22:23,134 --> 02:22:25,233
maybe for your kids, maybe
some time when you have.

3172
02:22:25,233 --> 02:22:26,213
- Sure.

3173
02:22:26,213 --> 02:22:28,711
- Thank you so much, Gary.
- Welcome.

3174
02:22:28,711 --> 02:22:30,298
- Thank you very much, guys.

3175
02:22:30,298 --> 02:22:31,631
Thank you, Gary!

3176
02:22:33,292 --> 02:22:35,151
Put your hands together
for Gary Vaynerchuk,

3177
02:22:35,151 --> 02:22:36,901
ladies and gentlemen!

3178
02:22:38,032 --> 02:22:38,865
- Thank you.

3179
02:22:38,865 --> 02:22:42,533
Cool, cool, cool, as
Marcus Krzastek would say,

3180
02:22:42,533 --> 02:22:45,170
great character at VaynerMedia.

3181
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:49,293
Anyway, nonetheless, hope
that went well for you,

3182
02:22:49,293 --> 02:22:52,435
and would love your comment below

3183
02:22:52,435 --> 02:22:54,799
of your favorite question
from the keynote,

3184
02:22:54,799 --> 02:22:56,728
not your favorite thing that I said

3185
02:22:56,728 --> 02:23:00,268
or the thing you learned,
but your favorite question,

3186
02:23:00,268 --> 02:23:03,752
and why, from this keynote, see you.

3187
02:23:03,752 --> 00:00:00,000
(intriguing music)
