1
00:00:04,816 --> 00:00:06,733
- You have already 150?

2
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:08,835
From 4,000 views?

3
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:11,813
That's gonna be a lot
of fucking applications.

4
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:13,231
- [DRock] A lot of creators.

5
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,898
- Everybody's a fucking creator.

6
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:25,663
- [DRock] It's 132, I lied.

7
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,459
- What?

8
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:31,993
- I'm just finish that
everyone's a creator,

9
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:35,826
I was waiting for your
like, to make the joke,

10
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,569
that even you're a creator,
even though you're not.

11
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:41,073
But you were in your own zone.

12
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:42,319
See?

13
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,076
Everyone thinks they're a fucking creator.

14
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:46,850
♫ We're unstoppable.

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,517
I'm on my way to a talk
to Chase, my client,

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,884
Vaynermedia's client.

17
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:54,058
Looking forward to that.

18
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:55,908
:28 in the morning,
Wednesday, hope you guys are

19
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:57,236
all doing super well.

20
00:00:57,236 --> 00:00:58,361
Trying to figure out
our cadence with the new

21
00:00:58,361 --> 00:00:59,372
edit style.

22
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:01,880
Reading all your feedback
the last few days.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,163
Not a bunch of sleep, so
kind of slugging along

24
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:06,282
this morning, a little out of it.

25
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:07,672
But we'll get it goin' in a minute here.

26
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:08,505
The game fires me up.

27
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:09,338
(heavy metal noise)

28
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:10,755
- You're welcome.

29
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:14,269
- You know, for me, the mentoring of Tyler

30
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:16,031
is super important.

31
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:18,844
He's my assistant, my lead assistant.

32
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:21,526
We have two now with Z, you've
seen her running around.

33
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:22,641
- Happy Friday, everyone.

34
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:24,704
- And I think a lot of you
who are running businesses

35
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:27,294
don't realize that the
conversations and the mentorship

36
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,718
on a day-to-day basis,
teaching them the long game,

37
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:31,677
the short game, what
your wants and needs are,

38
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:33,598
what you see in them,
how they can be better,

39
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:34,993
is a huge vulnerability.

40
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:36,683
You guys just want
everybody to click right in

41
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:39,176
to your expectations without
you putting in the work.

42
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:41,243
A lot of you have bad puppies and dogs

43
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:43,172
because you didn't spend the time up front

44
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:44,638
to put them in the right position.

45
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,488
A lot of you have kids
that aren't reaching their

46
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:49,100
expectations of you because
you took for granted

47
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,659
those early five or six years.

48
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,821
I mean, if you want
somebody to be successful

49
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,287
in the long term, you
have to disproportionately

50
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:56,920
put up work in the front
to make them successful.

51
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,616
And that's what I'm doing
with Tyler, and ironically

52
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:01,445
that's what I was teaching
him to do when somebody

53
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:04,492
new joins the team, and it's
something I've taught you,

54
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,954
DRock, that's something
that you've struggled with.

55
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:08,663
We've all struggled with that.

56
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:12,110
Like, you know, when you add
somebody new, your thought is,

57
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,210
this is gonna be easier
now, I can do more, I can do

58
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,677
better, I can do faster.

59
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,530
The problem is, for the
first 60, 90, 100 days,

60
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,305
you get slower because
you have to put it all

61
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:21,552
into them.

62
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:22,621
You have to answer all those questions,

63
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:25,517
you have to fix all their misses,

64
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:28,577
and so, and then what if
they don't even work out?

65
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:31,297
What if after 120 days,
it's not the right person?

66
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:33,867
You oftentimes don't
make the move that you

67
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,834
have to and bring in somebody
new, and then you have

68
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,215
a year of them, two or
three years, or some of you

69
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:40,032
are sitting on four and five and six years

70
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,928
of somebody who's not
good enough to do the

71
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,927
thing you want.

72
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:45,777
These are very difficult tasks of a CEO.

73
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:48,018
You see me at meetings--Gary
what do you do?--

74
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:50,268
Meetings and travel around.

75
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,422
I CEO, (beep)!

76
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:57,589
Also, next, we have creative
friends, Vayner, through Gary,

77
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,391
this is how we're positioning,
has created friends

78
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,387
all over the world, and
we would like to use them

79
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:06,405
to create some content
that is more, you know,

80
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:09,027
what I would call obtainable luxury.

81
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:10,166
Let's start using that.

82
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,916
(office chatter)

83
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,919
- [Woman] Hi Gar.

84
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,126
- [Gary] Hello, everyone.

85
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:17,182
- [Man] What's up?

86
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:18,418
- Craft Brew Alliance, that's cool.

87
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:19,416
Is he a nice guy?

88
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,793
- He's great, he is awesome.

89
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:21,790
- What is Craft Brew Alliance?

90
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,535
- They're Kona Beer, so they took a bunch

91
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:24,648
of small breweries...

92
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:25,732
- Can you introduce me to them?

93
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:26,725
- Yeah.

94
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:29,549
- I am on a mission to turn
my family's liquor store

95
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,983
into the leading craft
beer retailer in America,

96
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:36,783
and I want to start rounding
up all those relationships.

97
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,811
On this episode, the
wonderful Cy Wakeman is here.

98
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:42,160
Cy, you're on DailyV now.

99
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,132
- Okay.

100
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:44,501
- Officially.
- Awesome.

101
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,404
- Give me three words everybody
should be thinking about.

102
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:47,694
- Oh my gosh, more than three!

103
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,950
Stop believing everything you think.

104
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,357
Does that work?

105
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,190
- Yes.

106
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,080
- Okay, mwah.

107
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,422
- Love you, thanks for being on the show.

108
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:57,311
- Stop believing, believing is one word.

109
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:59,151
Stop believing in everything.

110
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,330
- [Crew] Everything, everything.

111
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,546
- You think.

112
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:03,551
Seven?

113
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:07,051
When I got asked three words, I nailed it.

114
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,930
(microphone noise)

115
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,215
Are you guys building
an agency or do you want

116
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:16,735
to build a media platform?

117
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:18,899
There's a place to play,
and I'm trying to figure out

118
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,066
where you guys want to go.

119
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,220
Or are you still debating it?

120
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,058
- So I'm happy to steal some of the air.

121
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:25,178
- I respect that, I'm debating 900 things.

122
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:28,466
- We obviously see the value in being able

123
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:32,446
to create our own content
and do that for our

124
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:34,106
brands and companies that we work with,

125
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,660
but we also recognize that there's a huge

126
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,276
social component that
we're still trying to

127
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,941
build out as well with the clients that we

128
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:41,215
bring in, but this platform
or this side of the

129
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,132
house, right...
- House.

130
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:47,167
- is solely focused on creating
content that's brand work

131
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,695
or creating original stories
or compelling stories

132
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:52,072
that we could tell and push out.

133
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:53,636
- Cool, so you guys know each other?

134
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:54,631
You said?

135
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:55,628
- Yeah, since college.

136
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,519
- Okay, and so the thing
that you're thinking about

137
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,034
now is you want to produce
original content around

138
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,113
you, how should I be thinking about...

139
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:04,517
What's my perspective?

140
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:05,998
I'm sure you guys have your perspective.

141
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:07,918
And what's the best, the
thing that you think maybe

142
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,956
I know even better than
your own subjectiveness

143
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:12,959
is the distribution of?

144
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,015
Okay

145
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:17,042
- 'Cause it's like what's
exciting from a storytelling

146
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:19,960
perspective was like, okay,
I'm not a big football person.

147
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,210
Well, the conduit to the story is here.

148
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,932
- [Gary] 100%.

149
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:29,673
- And if I could share
a story for a player,

150
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:32,778
and let folks know
what's inside the helmet,

151
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:34,809
using him as the conduit,
that's information

152
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,980
that ESPN doesn't get and HBO doesn't get.

153
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,445
- Yeah, I mean if your story,
listen, it's information.

154
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:41,525
- [Blonde Man] That's exciting to anyone.

155
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:44,402
- I think you know this,
they have versions of them

156
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:48,349
getting that, I think the bigger part is,

157
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,847
if you're a good storyteller,
you always have options.

158
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:51,859
I'll wait for that video.

159
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:52,947
- Yep.

160
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:54,177
- Love you, talk to you soon.

161
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:55,760
Right here is good.

162
00:05:57,312 --> 00:05:58,976
- Can I ask you really
quick just before I bounce

163
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:02,314
out of here, I really came
here to New York just to

164
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:03,364
meet you, really.

165
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,206
It's funny, I was just
sitting in there waiting,

166
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:09,720
and I got the notification
on my phone from YouTube,

167
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,271
from your channel, saying
you were looking for

168
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,133
content creators, and
I'm like, I don't know,

169
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,621
well, it's kinda what I do.

170
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:17,664
(laughing)

171
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:19,775
- Hey I'm a content creator!

172
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:20,990
Let me get right to the punch line.

173
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,941
I've figured out that what I'm offering is

174
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:27,689
incredibly interesting, and game changing,

175
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,703
and that I believe that
there are tens of thousands

176
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:32,734
of people that can either
afford to or believe that

177
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:35,085
it's the right strategic
decision for them,

178
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:38,795
to come and work on this
team for $15 an hour

179
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:41,351
for two years and I don't take lightly

180
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:42,743
New York City's expensive.

181
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:43,815
I believe in my thesis.

182
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:45,977
I believe that you should
live with four people.

183
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:47,364
If you want...

184
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:49,393
I believe in, I'm just offering things.

185
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:51,739
I also know that some
people have rich parents,

186
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,779
there's a million ways.

187
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,067
But we're about to hire
a lot of people who can

188
00:06:56,067 --> 00:07:00,411
do pre and post, film and
post, content for social,

189
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,161
and I'm gonna hire a lot of them.

190
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:07,478
So to be very blunt, if
you're yes to the first part,

191
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:10,955
well then you'd better send
them some content asap,

192
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:12,722
and give them some sense...

193
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:15,486
And by the way, we're not
looking for fire, we're

194
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:17,809
looking for nuances that
make us believe that we

195
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:20,041
can get them to fire.

196
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,015
It's the work ethic
that we're looking for.

197
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:24,149
We want somebody who's
excited about making

198
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,873
Snapchat content for 15
hours, somebody who's

199
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:29,219
excited about taking
that interview that you

200
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:31,473
just watched and chopping it up.

201
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:32,498
You know what we do.

202
00:07:32,498 --> 00:07:35,676
- I really just wanted
to think about for myself

203
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:38,966
being like an entrepreneur
somewhere similar to this,

204
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:41,174
or if not here, where I
can just leverage the brand

205
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:42,715
association...

206
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:44,470
- My man, I have no idea
why you're standing in

207
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,696
my office right now, but your timing...

208
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:48,693
(laughing)

209
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:49,688
It's true, I don't.

210
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:52,410
I don't know, I don't
know why you're here.

211
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,175
But I can tell you that
timing is really fucking good.

212
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:55,895
Because if you literally
came here three months ago,

213
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:57,738
I'd be like, yeah,
definitely send an email,

214
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,075
like we're not thinking
about it the way we did

215
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:01,072
five minutes ago.

216
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:02,773
Now we're thinking about
it like I'm gonna find

217
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,793
15 of them asap, because
I'm gonna teach 'em here

218
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:07,032
and then they're gonna
be the foundation of the

219
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,832
next version of Vaynermedia.

220
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:11,033
But if you're interested,
you need to set--

221
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,121
as long as--I mean at some level...

222
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,758
I don't know what their barometer of like

223
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:18,282
giving you a yes and giving
Susan who's watching now,

224
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:19,893
'cause I'm gonna put this whole video out,

225
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,367
'cause this explains what
I'm up to more than anything,

226
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,966
a yes, but you should do
that immediately, because

227
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:26,896
I'm gonna put out this video
of you and I right now,

228
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:29,688
in addition to the
form, pretty soon, like,

229
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:31,499
I don't know, tomorrow.

230
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,046
So I highly recommend you move quickly.

231
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,381
- Thank you.

232
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,223
- You're welcome.

233
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:38,913
And so look I can literally
talk an entire book out

234
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,080
in one breath.

235
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:42,243
- [Man On Speakerphone]
Yes you can (laughing).

236
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:45,570
- But I can't write two
sentences together coherently.

237
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,653
So in January, when Crushing It comes out,

238
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,153
it will be my fifth New York
Times best selling book.

239
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:53,512
I find that laughable
for a man who can't write

240
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:55,086
three sentences together.

241
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:58,026
It's because I created
infrastructure in Stephanie Lamb,

242
00:08:58,026 --> 00:09:01,916
my ghost writer, and I'm
betting on my strengths

243
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,875
of video and talking, gift of gab.

244
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,406
I'm the number one
followed person on Medium.

245
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:08,589
I can't write.

246
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,853
I have Colin Campbell, who's
a beast in transcribing me.

247
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:12,009
He listens to...

248
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,064
He'll listen...

249
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:14,176
I'm filming this right now.

250
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:15,805
He'll pitch me, hey, let's
do betting on your strengths.

251
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,784
He'll transcribe everything
here, but he'll be missing

252
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:18,800
some stuff.

253
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,418
He'll call me and interview me.

254
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,503
- Really it's just mindset.

255
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:23,825
So if you think failure is mental?

256
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:27,030
- I think people are,
I think people grew up

257
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,211
in an environment, it's nature/nurture.

258
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:33,328
You are scared and you
have allowed failure

259
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:35,149
to be on the offense,
and I don't want to spend

260
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,686
any time in this article
on whether you were

261
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,493
born with it or you were
conditioned to be that way

262
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:42,569
based on the way your
parents parented you,

263
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:43,651
or the environment you were in.

264
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,605
I just want you to recognize that truth

265
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:47,897
and start the process
of putting all your time

266
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:51,964
and energy in figuring out
how to go backwards on that.

267
00:09:51,964 --> 00:09:53,080
- [Man On Speakerphone] Got it okay,

268
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,250
lean into your strengths, got it.

269
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,170
- Good content day.

270
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,353
What up?

271
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:59,679
It's finally official, I
had to triple confirm it,

272
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,102
so I wasn't promoting it.

273
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:04,602
October 9th, Columbus
Day Monday, in New Jersey

274
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:07,703
at the West Orange Manor,
we have the wine library

275
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:10,881
charity event where we
donate all the proceeds

276
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:14,497
to I think the Crohn's
and Colitis Foundation,

277
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:15,684
obviously with AJ.

278
00:10:15,684 --> 00:10:17,505
And I'm doing something
super cool, which is a

279
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:20,540
high end wine tasting and Q&A.

280
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,318
I just wanted to make a quick
video about the $500 ticket

281
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:27,914
in this email that you saw,
business and wine Q&A session.

282
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:31,084
This event is going to be
part of the super tasting

283
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:32,107
that you see.

284
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,689
Super tasting is something
we started 2001, right?

285
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:35,661
16 years ago.

286
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:37,232
If you are in the tri-state
area, or if you've ever

287
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:40,288
wanted to come and really
chop it up with me,

288
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:42,268
this is the plane ticket you need to buy.

289
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:44,006
Columbus Day Monday, New Jersey.

290
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:45,975
There's a limit of 40 or
so tickets for this $500

291
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:49,484
business and wine high end tasting.

292
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:50,488
I love you back.

293
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:52,511
Seth, Seth? Our Seth? Seth!

294
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:53,344
That's you?

295
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:54,213
Seth, you're supposed to be fucking...

296
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:56,842
Seth, you need to be working here.

297
00:10:56,842 --> 00:10:58,717
No wonder my podcast is slipping

298
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:00,291
down the ranks.

299
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,171
Seth is like on Instagram Live.

300
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:03,735
Seth, what do you have
to say for yourself here?

301
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,383
- I got your notifications on.

302
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,094
- Are you excited about the super tasting?

303
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:08,137
Are you gonna go?

304
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:09,082
- I would love to go.

305
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,111
- Good, sold one.

306
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,467
All right, super tasting.

307
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:12,967
Check it, see ya'.

308
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,337
♫ Reachin' out for me.

309
00:11:32,154 --> 00:11:33,170
- Hey Allison.

310
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,167
- Hi, how are you?

311
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,246
Nice to meet you.

312
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:36,323
- Nice to meet you, how are things?

313
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:37,534
- Very, very good.

314
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,642
- You know the whole 60
second, you know the whole

315
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:41,258
60 second club thing?

316
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:43,753
60 second club is all of
the next year on Instagram,

317
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:46,612
I'm gonna reward my hardcore
community for everybody

318
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:48,942
who likes an Instagram
post and leaves a comment

319
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,274
in the first minute of an Instagram post.

320
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:52,929
So that's why you gotta
turn on notifications

321
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,088
so you see it comes in.

322
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,026
A bunch of you are in
that and you got your

323
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,360
notifications on on Instagram,

324
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,804
which I continue to recommend you do.

325
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:01,721
Well, I give tshirts and books out,

326
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:05,349
but sometimes I give the
ultimate prize, which is

327
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,932
access to me, so this was
a 30 minute win, right?

328
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:08,338
- Yes.

329
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:09,334
- Where're you from?

330
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:10,693
- I'm from Florida, but I live in Atlanta.

331
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:13,151
- You know what you need to do, right?

332
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:14,522
You need to try as many
things as fucking possible.

333
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:16,822
- That's what I'm trying to do right now.

334
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:18,209
- But I mean for real, like you need to to

335
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:19,714
and hula dance.

336
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:22,916
You need to go try to
take pizza making classes.

337
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,732
You need to travel with scrap up money,

338
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:28,637
and like, everybody can do everything,

339
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:30,586
with very little money.

340
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:31,656
Everybody thinks you need money.

341
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:32,665
Barter.

342
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:35,065
Tyler has skills in making videos, right?

343
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,116
- [Winner] Yeah.

344
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:38,024
- He could literally do
anything he wants in the world.

345
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,122
You want to do something, barter.

346
00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:42,328
Barter is a real trick.

347
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,229
If you've got something,
like, how do you think

348
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,055
