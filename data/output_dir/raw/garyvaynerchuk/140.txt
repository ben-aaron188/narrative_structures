1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:01,685
- I don't know how this became my life,

2
00:00:01,685 --> 00:00:04,625
but D-Rock just woke
me up on a text saying

3
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:07,264
we need a question of
the day for the vlog so,

4
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:08,265
A. Fuck me,

5
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:10,164
B. Question of the day.

6
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:13,164
♫ We're unstoppable

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,080
Hey guys, I'm sitting here
at the airport in Hong Kong

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,838
on my way to Singapore.

9
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:21,927
Wanted to tell you about
a keynote I gave in Utah

10
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:24,874
for my homie Shawn Doris at VidSummit.

11
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:25,707
Real good stuff.

12
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:26,540
- [D-Rock] Yeah.

13
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,108
- Um, this is really made for everybody,

14
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:32,278
actually this could be
one of the more valuable

15
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:35,219
DailyVees because if you
consume my content on YouTube

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,814
a lot of you have aspirations to succeed

17
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:39,822
in the YouTube environment.

18
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:42,408
And this was clearly, and I mean clearly,

19
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:44,638
a creator's oriented talk.

20
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:46,926
When I give talks, a lot
of my talks right now

21
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:50,837
are about marketing and
businesses leveraging

22
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:52,520
the current state of attention.

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,235
This was a very different talk,

24
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:55,840
a very different Q & A.

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,088
Had some good moments--

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,315
- [D-Rock] The Q & A was incredible.

27
00:00:58,315 --> 00:00:59,537
- The Q & A's, D-Rock,

28
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,020
the Q & A's are always incredible right?

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,853
- Yes.

30
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:06,080
- Sitting here, actually laying here

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,580
on the flight from Hong Kong to Singapore.

32
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:12,464
Pretty dark out there.

33
00:01:12,464 --> 00:01:15,214
Anyway, just jammin' on my email.

34
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,201
Hustlin', tryin' to get some questions.

35
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:22,265
That's it.

36
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,948
- [D-Rock] I need to go now.

37
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:27,843
- I've gotta prep for
this call in two minutes.

38
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:29,867
- [D-Rock] Oh that's
right, you have a call.

39
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:30,923
- I work D-Rock.

40
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,067
(laughs)

41
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:32,900
- [Woman] Oh really?

42
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,790
(laughs)

43
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,085
- Uh, gotta have some fun on
these fuckin' 24 hour flights,

44
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:40,357
or travel schedules.

45
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:42,747
Anyway, nonetheless,

46
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:45,094
this is a standout episode for anybody

47
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:46,197
who wants to become a creator,

48
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:48,536
become a YouTube channel.

49
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:49,720
Take advantage of the current state,

50
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,831
and really this is a interesting keynote

51
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,823
that sets up Crushing It, my
book coming out in January.

52
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:57,957
And so I hope you enjoy it.

53
00:01:57,957 --> 00:01:58,945
- You can put the link right down there.

54
00:01:58,945 --> 00:01:59,867
- Oh, we can put a link.

55
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:00,700
Oh we haven't, you know what,

56
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,942
we have not filmed the
Amazon right hook yet.

57
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:06,489
You know why, because
I'm very focused on this.

58
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:08,133
We've been very focused--

59
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:08,966
Pointing at D-Rock?

60
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,686
Let's just, there we go.

61
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:15,142
But, soon we will do the
Crushing It book push.

62
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:17,867
Anyway, watch this keynote.

63
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,681
- [Man] Alright, enjoy
your Gary V. time guys.

64
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,102
Gary, you need a mic?

65
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,618
- I think I'm mic'd, so I
think I'm good thank you.

66
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:23,451
- [Man] Okay, you just,

67
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:24,722
let me know if you need anything.

68
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:25,729
- I appreciate it.

69
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,562
Hey.

70
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:29,887
It's great to see all of you.

71
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:32,272
Really excited to be
here and really excited

72
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:35,055
to focus on a couple of different things.

73
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,911
So, I really want to go into Q & A,

74
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:38,039
so where are the mics?

75
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,207
I just want to get a sense
of where the mics are.

76
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:41,040
Do we have runners?

77
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,695
Or do you have guys have--

78
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,528
They're gonna be in the aisle?

79
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:44,361
Okay, cool.

80
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,759
So, feel free to jump up at any point

81
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,694
and get into the Q & A.

82
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:48,209
I mean, really from my standpoint

83
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,350
this is a super unique kind of conference

84
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,488
because there is so many people here

85
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:55,470
that I know, have known for a long time,

86
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,470
back in the day, have watched from afar,

87
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,374
cheer for to be successful,

88
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:03,295
and I think it's a super interesting time

89
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,295
for this conference to be thrown.

90
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,318
Because I think for a lot of you,

91
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:09,497
for a lot of you,

92
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:11,665
there's an intuitive understanding

93
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:13,920
that we're in a moment in time, right?

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,458
For me, I've been very lucky.

95
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,178
I think I trade on moments in time.

96
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:21,601
I knew in 1996, seven,

97
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,145
that this internet thing
was gonna be something,

98
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:27,033
and my dad's liquor store
had to take advantage of it.

99
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,459
I knew that this email thing blew my--

100
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,681
I mean, there's a lot
of youngsters in here.

101
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:34,370
How many people here
were on email in 1997?

102
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,518
Raise your hand.

103
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:36,351
Awesome.

104
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:37,184
So, a lot.

105
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,017
Fuck, okay.

106
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,207
(audience laughs)

107
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:42,566
You know I had 91% open rates

108
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:46,285
on Wine Library's email
service in 1997, '98.

109
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,070
And that was me selling wine

110
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,945
on this new thing called email,

111
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:54,990
that didn't cost me
money to make a catalog

112
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,646
to send it in the mail.

113
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:58,630
And it was instantaneous
the second the wine

114
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,855
came into the store, it was out the door.

115
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,326
It might be tough for people to understand

116
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,243
how holy fuck that was.

117
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:08,720
And it's basically the
same way I feel about

118
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,729
this entire audience
right now in this moment.

119
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,896
You know, the influencer thing
has been around a long time.

120
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,791
You know like, when I first met QPark

121
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,217
in my office, like six, seven years ago,

122
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:24,640
and telling all these Vine kids,

123
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,088
like, "You're gonna be famous."

124
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:27,537
Like, "This is real."

125
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:30,120
I remember their feedback
to me was very much like,

126
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,370
"Are you sure?"

127
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:33,336
Some of them were like, "Yeah."

128
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:36,774
But not to the level I think
that I spoke to the conviction.

129
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:38,528
It was only because I'd already lived

130
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,473
that three, four years earlier.

131
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:43,961
I started a YouTube channel in 2006.

132
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,719
Right, my wine show was there.

133
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:46,816
And that was on the back end of watching

134
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:48,810
what happened with bloggers.

135
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,067
Before video was even a thing online.

136
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:54,290
Or podcasts the first
time it meant something.

137
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,554
Not this new iteration.

138
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:59,092
This the same old game forever.

139
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:01,162
And the biggest thing
that I want to get across

140
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:05,574
to every every single
person here is regret.

141
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:09,103
My entire talk right now
is gonna be about regret.

142
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:11,084
And let me explain what I mean by that.

143
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:12,951
I'm not sure that was worth
a whoo, but I'll take it.

144
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:14,606
(audience laughs)

145
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,189
It is my intuition,

146
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,438
that if you don't squeeze the opportunity

147
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:22,086
that's in front of all of us right now

148
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:25,601
as hard as you fucking
can, you will have regret.

149
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:29,075
If you are smart enough, and aware enough,

150
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,625
to even be here today,

151
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,792
you were ready ahead of 99%
of the players in our society.

152
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,515
I do not believe that people in this room

153
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:44,186
are quantifying the fact they
even know this world exists,

154
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:45,817
and are willing to take the financial

155
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,727
and time allocation to be here.

156
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,946
How big of an advantage that is,

157
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:52,361
how far along you actually are.

158
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:54,522
Because when you're in the system,

159
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:57,252
it feels like everybody's doing it.

160
00:05:57,252 --> 00:05:59,282
You're amongst yourselves.

161
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:01,865
The same way it felt like
in 2006 and seven for me

162
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:03,961
with Twitter and Facebook.

163
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:08,843
Like, we all knew social
media, but the world didn't.

164
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:11,676
The influencers have the leverage.

165
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:16,841
You have the leverage.

166
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,729
If you're paying attention to
what's going on in the world

167
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,616
of media consumption right now,

168
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:24,485
there are more buyers
of content than ever.

169
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:28,004
Facebook, and Amazon, and Google, and Hulu

170
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,947
are gonna bid for the NFL and the NBA.

171
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:33,427
We are not down to three
media companies anymore.

172
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:37,401
If you understand how the
chess plays out in this game,

173
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,262
the only thing that you need to make sure,

174
00:06:40,262 --> 00:06:42,697
is that you don't believe so much

175
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:44,606
in the thing that got you here,

176
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:46,967
that you stay on it too long.

177
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:50,279
The vulnerability to
this room, is one thing,

178
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,327
you figure out YouTube, or Facebook Watch,

179
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:56,737
or Instagram, or Snapchat,
or something else.

180
00:06:56,737 --> 00:07:00,307
You win, and then you never innovate.

181
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:02,984
And then when that platform declines,

182
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:05,144
you decline with it.

183
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:07,969
As long as everybody here is religious,

184
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,038
around creating and innovating,

185
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,710
in every channel as it evolves,

186
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,662
and you stay in the yes business.

187
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,509
How many people here are
with brands or agencies?

188
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,238
Raise your hand.

189
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:23,396
Great, so for you guys and gals,

190
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:26,188
it's about understanding how under-priced

191
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:28,795
this opportunity is for brands right now.

192
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:29,628
Right?

193
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:32,108
And just following where
the under-priced nature is.

194
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:33,938
YouTube influencers,

195
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:37,028
when I was buying them
in 2007, eight and nine,

196
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:39,093
were really fuckin' cheap.

197
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:39,926
Right?

198
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,239
They were tens of dollars, for free stuff.

199
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,873
Not hundreds, not thousands,

200
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:47,336
not tens of thousands and
not hundreds of thousands.

201
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:50,785
And basically very
honestly, I have one pitch.

202
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:51,921
It's the same one.

203
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,849
It's just pattern recognition.

204
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,022
Where is the attention
of the end consumer?

205
00:07:57,022 --> 00:08:00,525
And where do people think it's
over-priced or under-priced?

206
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:04,435
Why do companies and
organizations spend millions

207
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:05,876
and tens of millions of dollars

208
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,851
to produce television and film?

209
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:10,459
And brands spend to sponsor it?

210
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,002
And what's that worth?

211
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:14,170
Versus me throwing dollars towards many

212
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,728
of the faces in this room.

213
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,625
Even at numbers that they
can't believe they now get.

214
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,721
I still deem as grossly under-priced

215
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:25,338
for what it is they get in
return as of this moment.

216
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,666
Even the top YouTubers
and Instagram celebrities

217
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:32,164
I think are grossly
under-priced most of the time

218
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:34,113
for what they give in return.

219
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,592
Which is unbelievable levels of awareness,

220
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:39,419
and relevancy in the world
that we live in right now.

221
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,246
I live in a world in my brain

222
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,199
that this is the only thing that matters,

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,840
and basically nothing else does.

224
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,344
I don't even own a fucking computer.

225
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:48,768
Like this is it.

226
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:51,458
I run a $200 million media
company, I live my life.

227
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,444
I have not had a laptop
for a year and a half.

228
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:55,648
I actually had to do something
the other day on a laptop,

229
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:57,717
and it was not like riding a bike.

230
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:59,024
I was like, what the fuck?

231
00:08:59,024 --> 00:08:59,857
You know?

232
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:02,559
(audience laughs)

233
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,107
When you understand that this is it,

234
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,421
that this is the remote
control of our lives,

235
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,472
and that 50% of the time
spent on this device,

236
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:12,475
is on a platform that delivers content,

237
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:14,536
A.K.A. a social network.

238
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:17,008
It starts getting real serious, real fast.

239
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:21,366
And I just wanna remind
everybody, it's not going back.

240
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,201
This is only going to evolve forward.

241
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:26,600
So, I guess the thing that
I really wanna get across,

242
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,527
A. Is I wanna really do Q & A,

243
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,602
'cause I wanna answer
people's direct question.

244
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:33,264
Because you can see my
pontificating anywhere you want,

245
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:35,570
anytime you want, somewhere on the web.

246
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,311
So please take advantage of that.

247
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:41,478
And B. I've watched this
over, and over and over again.

248
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:44,662
I did it, Q did it.

249
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:47,574
We have these moments
when we have leadership,

250
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:49,304
and then we let it get away from us

251
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:51,366
because we take for granted.

252
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:54,168
And then we look back, and we regret.

253
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:57,190
I had leadership in YouTube and Twitter.

254
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,152
I left YouTube for six years,

255
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,192
went on Viddler, did other things,

256
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:02,092
like ran a wine business.

257
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:04,495
Like, this is what I'm most worried about.

258
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:06,505
That you know it, that you're right.

259
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,641
You're here right now,

260
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,692
and you're either not working hard enough,

261
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,128
or not believing enough in
how right you actually are.

262
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:14,866
And so when I really
thought about the talk

263
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:17,618
that I would give here
amongst everybody else,

264
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,698
I just was like, "Fuck I'm gonna suffocate

265
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:21,361
"the shit out of everybody."

266
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:24,108
(audience chuckles)

267
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,513
In a very positive way.

268
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:27,409
(audience laughs)

269
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,154
So that they understand like,

270
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:31,073
please, please, please,

271
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:33,665
don't look back at this
talk in three years

272
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,666
and be like, "Fuck, I
wish I'd listened to him,

273
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,304
"and I wish I did a little more work,

274
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,052
"created a little more content,

275
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:42,205
"took it a little bit more serious."

276
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:43,564
Because for the last decade

277
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:46,764
of this distribution disruption,

278
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,853
that the internet has done to our society,

279
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,908
there have been people that
have stumbled into the moment

280
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:53,254
that you're in right now.

281
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,254
You're here.

282
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,824
And just don't realize
how far ahead they are,

283
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,426
because you're stuck
being used to each other.

284
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:04,250
98% of America has no idea

285
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,762
what the fuck is going on in here.

286
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:08,834
(audience laughs)

287
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,958
That is our opportunity.

288
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,971
And so, I think that we need
to really take a step back

289
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:15,291
and start thinking about a couple things.

290
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,274
Number one, context is
much more of a factor

291
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:20,495
for your life than people talk about.

292
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:23,151
We talk so much about
content and storytelling,

293
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:24,354
and that's great,

294
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:28,201
but the lack of context that
I see from so many of you,

295
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:30,577
you take a piece of content and you think,

296
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:34,033
just posting it everywhere,
it's going to be successful,

297
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,091
is a huge mistake.

298
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:36,898
Please do not use all

299
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:39,583
the social media channels as distribution.

300
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,766
Think smartly how to make
native content within them.

301
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:45,222
In the same way that you're
gonna act differently here

302
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:47,414
than you will with your parents at dinner,

303
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:49,691
than you will with your
buddies on a weekend in Vegas,

304
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:51,412
than you will in a business meeting

305
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:53,090
with the biggest CEO in the world.

306
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,817
You're still you, but
you're slightly different

307
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:57,217
in all those environments.

308
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,818
Your content can't be successful

309
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:01,754
on Facebook and YouTube the same way

310
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,515
'cause they're different platforms.

311
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:07,019
There is not enough
religion around us creators,

312
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,564
around context of the platform.

313
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:12,485
Too much is being put just on the content,

314
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:15,686
and that is a very important variable.

315
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:16,614
Very, very important.

316
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:17,850
So please think about that.

317
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,326
Two, in a world where
there's a lot of people

318
00:12:20,326 --> 00:12:23,102
that should stand up here and
give the presentation over me,

319
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:25,718
when it comes to
thumbnails, and headlines,

320
00:12:25,718 --> 00:12:27,720
and what I would call "growth hacking".

321
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,374
A. It's super important,

322
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,212
but I feel like everybody here

323
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:34,210
is either grounded in it,
or knows it's importance,

324
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,602
and will continue to try
to learn those tactics.

325
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:39,452
The one thing that I'm
seeing from a lot creators

326
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:40,970
in this room specifically,

327
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,587
and outside, similar to a
lot of the creators in here,

328
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:47,476
is that you're getting
so growth hack oriented

329
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,564
that it's manipulating and
diluting the actual story.

330
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:52,987
And it's just about hacking
and getting the numbers,

331
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:55,165
which is great for the short term.

332
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:58,579
But is the reason so many people
have lost in the long term

333
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,046
because they become mathematical machines,

334
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,308
and their story becomes less authentic.

335
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:05,604
And they become a
caricature of themselves,

336
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:08,598
that are basically pandering to the growth

337
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:10,828
in the category they
wanna be successful in.

338
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:12,435
This has been the single reason

339
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:14,804
I feel like I've had continuous success,

340
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:17,180
because I just stay kind of in my thing,

341
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,076
and if it works at the time at YouTube,

342
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:21,196
or Instagram or Snapchat, mazel tov.

343
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:23,276
And if it doesn't, I'm okay with that.

344
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:25,101
I'm okay with people
having more followers,

345
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:26,012
or making more money.

346
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:28,198
Because I know when I deviate,

347
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,745
you have only a chapter
instead of an entire career.

348
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,723
So I implore so many of you,
I understand especially,

349
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,731
shit, hanging out with everybody here.

350
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:39,153
It's like, "Oh, you have four
million fuckin' subscribers?"

351
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,777
Like, you know all that shit, I get it.

352
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,392
It gets very competitive, we're humans.

353
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:43,336
I get it.

354
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:46,168
But please do me a favor,
please, please, please,

355
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:49,530
be religious to hold onto
your truths and your stories.

356
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,461
Because when you start diluting from that,

357
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:55,501
you start beginning the process
of you becoming irrelevant.

358
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,334
It's important.

359
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:57,167
You like that one?

360
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,000
It's good right?

361
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,712
(audience applauds)

362
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:02,837
Got an interesting one,

363
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,485
that I thought would be a
good theme for everybody.

364
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,152
We need to ask more.

365
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:11,553
I get so many emails and
DMs from so many of you,

366
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:12,617
of like, how.

367
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:15,075
The answer is, ask more.

368
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:16,777
How do you get brand deals?

369
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:18,496
Email every brand on earth.

370
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:21,401
(audience laughs)

371
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:22,365
I mean this.

372
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:23,900
You know, I know some of you have seen,

373
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,950
like me talk about Instagram DM.

374
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,569
Like I'm getting 50 emails a week,

375
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,838
from people, that same basic title.

376
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,782
Doing the Instagram DM
changed my fuckin' life.

377
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:38,172
A stunning thing happens when you ask.

378
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,672
Somebody says yes.

379
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,322
So, I think one of the biggest things

380
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:44,938
that is happening in this
room when I think about it,

381
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:48,855
is that people's egos
are getting in their way.

382
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:53,631
The feelings of getting
hurt when somebody says no,

383
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:56,370
hurts your ego so much that it stops you

384
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,980
from even asking in the first place.

385
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,789
It is stunning to me how much
I like when people say no.

386
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:05,478
I prefer when people say no.

387
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:08,613
I tend to bounce into
different industries,

388
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:11,221
in my career, because
once I become big in one,

389
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:14,884
and it becomes easy to yes, I hate it.

390
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:17,845
So, there's a lot of
fuckin' fancy people in here

391
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:20,430
who think they're bigger
than they actually are.

392
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,414
(audience laughs)

393
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:24,429
And so I highly recommend,

394
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,589
that you check your
fuckin' ego at the door

395
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:28,253
because it's the substantial aspect

396
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:31,320
that's holding you back
from your next chapter.

397
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,742
So, please, please,
please start asking more.

398
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:35,134
More DM, more email.

399
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,051
And, 51-49.

400
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,514
When you're reaching out to somebody

401
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:41,118
that you want something from,

402
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:43,190
it's a good idea to start with

403
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,117
what you're gonna do for them.

404
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:47,693
I'm aware that you won
a $100,000 sneaker deal.

405
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:48,839
I get it.

406
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,018
The fuck's in it for the sneaker?

407
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:51,976
Right?

408
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:54,433
So don't take for granted
subscribers or comments.

409
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,967
Be thoughtful, understand
what they're about,

410
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,527
pay attention, do your homework, listen,

411
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,399
pay attention to what
they're doing on social.

412
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,240
30 minutes of homework can articulate

413
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,979
a far better way to have a conversation

414
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:09,535
with somebody that you
want something from.

415
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,951
(light audience applause)

416
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:11,784
Thanks mom.

417
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:14,617
(audience laughs)

418
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:17,828
Distribution.

419
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:22,372
Do not become completely vulnerable

420
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,975
to YouTube or Facebook.

421
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,326
This is imperative.

422
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:28,502
This is super duper one
of the biggest things

423
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,562
that people make a mistake of.

424
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:34,264
Win there, but always
have 20% of your energy

425
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:35,960
on testing new things,

426
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,048
even when you feel you
don't have any more time

427
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:40,280
'cause you're working
so hard to do the thing.

428
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,722
Because, the reality is,

429
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:43,555
all I'm doing right now,

430
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:45,400
if you go back and watch this talk,

431
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,526
all I'm doing right now is systematically

432
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:48,990
breaking down the things that I've watched

433
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,574
for the last 10 years,

434
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:53,991
that have stopped people from succeeding.

435
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:56,155
It's all these little subtle things

436
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:57,323
that I'm dropping on you now,

437
00:16:57,323 --> 00:16:59,651
these are the things that
stop you from succeeding,

438
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,037
which is what I spend
all my time on, right?

439
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:02,238
Stop the vulnerabilities.

440
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,549
All of us are on a boat,
with a bunch of holes,

441
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:06,411
and you're just putting
your finger in all of them.

442
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:08,492
I'm just trying to give
you the cliché ones,

443
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:10,898
that I and all of you are going through,

444
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,218
and it's just universal
and it will be forever.

445
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:16,779
One of the great things is, listen,

446
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:17,722
especially for this group,

447
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:19,116
YouTube, and Facebook and Instagram,

448
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:21,705
these are just imperative monsters.

449
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:23,994
Until they're not.

450
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:25,977
And, what has been stunning to me--

451
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,298
For example, here is
something stunning to me.

452
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,057
It is stunning to me of how
smart this room is, right?

453
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:33,793
I just said, look 98%
doesn't know you're here.

454
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:37,351
You know like, this is real in here.

455
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:41,636
And, how many of you have
stopped doing Snapchat?

456
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:44,636
Like, I laugh at your lack of skill.

457
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:51,044
And here's what I mean
by that harsh statement.

458
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:55,044
Most, under 30 year olds
are living on Snapchat.

459
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,719
One way or the other.

460
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,298
The data's very clear.

461
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:01,748
It's not like, you know
you could be sitting there,

462
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,378
and be like, "Not true,
me and my three friends

463
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:04,509
"aren't on it anymore."

464
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:05,724
That's nice Karen.

465
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:07,611
(audience laughs)

466
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:09,732
I'm talking about big data.

467
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:11,804
I'm talking about the user numbers.

468
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:13,884
I don't give a fuck
that you don't anymore,

469
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,443
or your neighbor said something,

470
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:18,662
or the 13 year old girl down
the street said it's dead.

471
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:19,576
I don't give a fuck.

472
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:20,926
I care about the macro data,

473
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:22,760
and the macro data shows very clearly

474
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,493
that there is hundreds of millions

475
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:26,481
of fuckers on this platform.

476
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,895
And just because Instagram
stole it's features,

477
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:32,056
which by the way, they
didn't steal their features,

478
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:34,714
features are not IP, that's business.

479
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,672
Everybody here stole a
ton of shit from Casey.

480
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:40,505
(audience laughs)

481
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:45,052
And so, it's not about stealing.

482
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:48,305
It's about features, great.

483
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:50,953
But there's a huge--

484
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:52,034
I'm giving you little tidbits,

485
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:54,334
there's a huge opportunity
for so many of you,

486
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:58,681
'cause I live on supply
and demand of attention.

487
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:01,025
And when a lot of people left Snapchat

488
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:02,808
to only focus on Instagram Stories,

489
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,875
'cause, why should I do two things?

490
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,241
It's easier to do one.

491
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:09,693
Or whatever other fancy
reason you made up that call,

492
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:12,394
it left a white space
for enormous opportunity

493
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:15,453
and I highly recommend
Shonduras comes outta retirement

494
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,093
and starts drawing again.

495
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:18,957
And, a million other things.

496
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,333
And so, these are the
things that fascinate me.

497
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,861
Becoming too one dimensional,

498
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,269
not creating content
native for the platform

499
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,654
and the thing that most is
running through my mind,

500
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:32,070
which is, I'm trying to get
into the mind of this audience.

501
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,070
When you have the ambition,
A.K.A. the audacity,

502
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:41,494
to have your living be you just living,

503
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:46,606
not having enough time is not an excuse.

504
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:48,197
The people that have been
sitting here and saying like,

505
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:49,358
"Well how the fuck am I?

506
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:50,822
"You know I'm already--"

507
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,489
You, want to get paid
hundreds of thousands,

508
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,351
and or millions of dollars a year,

509
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:00,626
running around the earth.

510
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:01,862
(audience laughs)

511
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:05,018
You have to quantify how amazing that is.

512
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:08,935
It's obnoxious that it's
actually a real thing.

513
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:14,710
If you go read the Amazon reviews
of my first book Crush It,

514
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,303
that came out in 2009 where
I talked about all this,

515
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:20,344
people are like, "Get
the fuck out of here.

516
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,237
"Nobody's gonna pay people to like,

517
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:24,197
"do things on a device."

518
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:25,743
Like, it was so ridi--

519
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:27,991
That's only eight years ago.

520
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:28,824
Right?

521
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:31,760
So please, please understand

522
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,358
the obnoxious level of
audacity that we have

523
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:39,175
to be interesting enough
to get paid to just do.

524
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:42,458
And please then deploy the work ethic

525
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,628
that is needed to actually pull this off.

526
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:47,658
The biggest fear I have is for the people

527
00:20:47,658 --> 00:20:50,073
that are actually having success.

528
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:52,089
Because complacency kicks in,

529
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,057
and you just get into pattern recognition.

530
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:56,008
There's a lot of you
here that are winning.

531
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:58,464
And, the thing that I'm
really most passionate about

532
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:00,831
is making sure you're
challenging yourself.

533
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:02,902
There's so much more to
do with what you're doing.

534
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:04,470
But it's only gonna be incremental.

535
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,414
You're only gonna get paid
a little more to speak.

536
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:08,382
You're only gonna sell
a little more merch.

537
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:11,614
You're only gonna get a
bigger deal a little bit more.

538
00:21:11,614 --> 00:21:13,118
It's still being creative.

539
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:14,330
Like, to me one of the big things

540
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,473
with video creators that I'm
really trying to challenge

541
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:20,010
is to start paying attention
to voice a lot more.

542
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,122
I think a lot of you, and
again I know a lot of you,

543
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:23,465
and I've watched a lot of people

544
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:25,083
that used the hashtag last night and,

545
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,709
thanks for the dude
that offered me a drink.

546
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:29,148
You know, but I wasn't here.

547
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:32,495
You know, a lot of you when
I went down the rabbit hole

548
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:34,557
on my flight yesterday
just to get a sense,

549
00:21:34,557 --> 00:21:38,666
so many of you could be so
successful in podcast form.

550
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,073
But you haven't even gone there.

551
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:43,953
So many of you could create
such an incredible Alexa skill,

552
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:46,100
or an Alexa briefing that can change

553
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,487
the opportunity for you.

554
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:51,934
Guys, as somebody who was
there from day one of YouTube,

555
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:53,518
YouTube is mature.

556
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:55,246
Instagram is mature.

557
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:56,910
The next land grabs,

558
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,830
the things that get you from zero to hero,

559
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,102
are staring you directly
in the face right now.

560
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:05,470
The problem is, some level of your success

561
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,014
is stopping you from allocating time

562
00:22:08,014 --> 00:22:09,967
to take the chance on the new thing

563
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:12,072
that can disproportionately leap frog you

564
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:13,739
three or four spots.

565
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:17,374
So, please let's keep
challenging ourselves.

566
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:19,750
Please let's understand what's
actually happening here.

567
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,806
Please understand how much
of a ridiculous advantage

568
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:24,358
you have right now,

569
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,319
and how much more you need to squeeze.

570
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,066
Please understand every
13 year old in the world

571
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:29,942
wants to be you,

572
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:33,126
so supply and demand is coming.

573
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:35,214
Everybody is gonna do this,

574
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:38,080
which means you gotta be
disproportionately better

575
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,815
in the next year or two.

576
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:43,294
So, just like coders and
developers got paid a lot

577
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:44,535
and right now all their parents

578
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:46,160
want their kids to be developers,

579
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,741
which means, it's actually
gonna be commoditized,

580
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:50,501
and they're gonna get paid a lot less.

581
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,222
Same for us.

582
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:54,181
There's not a 15 year old
in this fuckin' country

583
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:55,998
that doesn't have this job

584
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:59,670
as one of their first one
or two things they wanna do.

585
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,702
Which means, it's going to be harder,

586
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:05,039
because the brands, and
the AdSense and the merch

587
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,737
is gonna get split
between 83 million people

588
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:09,869
instead of 8.3 million people.

589
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:11,097
Got it?

590
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:14,960
And you're only so cute
and charismatic, Shonduras.

591
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,133
(audience laughs)

592
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:20,553
So, that's the state of
the union of this space.

593
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:22,520
I would love for people to
start lining up for questions

594
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,145
'cause I'd like to get into more detail.

595
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:26,162
So please do that, and when I see enough,

596
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:28,122
good, looks like we're
gonna get there quickly,

597
00:23:28,122 --> 00:23:30,250
we'll get into it.

598
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,000
And, I know a lot of you came out

599
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,519
for this event because I talked about it

600
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,016
and I saw a lot of the
tweets ahead of time.

601
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:41,255
And I just want you guys to
know I'm ridiculously humbled

602
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,999
and thankful for the
attention and the admiration.

603
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:46,011
And I really, really, really, really,

604
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:48,318
have a lot of heart for this community.

605
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:51,223
And, I thank you for having me.

606
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,056
Thanks.

607
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,056
(audience applauds)

608
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:59,036
Okay, let's get into the good shit.

609
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:02,827
- First of all thank you,

610
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:05,759
and I know you've inspired
a bunch of us here.

611
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,316
Um, you talk about regret,

612
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:10,468
and you talk about not doing shit.

613
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:12,668
And I'm here, I'm a small guy.

614
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:16,335
I own two small businesses
in Austin, Texas.

615
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,843
I wanna get better.

616
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:22,033
I know that this is an
opportunity to be first in line

617
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:24,306
with about 800 people.

618
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:27,030
I'll do whatever I have
to do to go to New York.

619
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:31,046
Even if it's scrub your
floors with my toothbrush.

620
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:33,463
Is that at all a possibility?

621
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:36,019
- Well you could definitely come

622
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:37,239
and scrub our floors with a toothbrush.

623
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:39,262
- Okay.
(audience laughs)

624
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:40,214
- What's the second part?

625
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:42,086
- The second part is I
just wanna get better

626
00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:44,383
and I know by doing that I
have to learn from the best.

627
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,737
I've been following you.

628
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:47,254
I don't even wanna follow you,

629
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:48,887
I just wanna follow your team.

630
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,363
I'm a creator, and I'm
just asking for that.

631
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:53,627
- Cool, so right, do me a favor.

632
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:54,995
Email gary@vaynermedia.

633
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:55,828
- Yes sir.

634
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:56,748
- In the title, put I'm Ryan,

635
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:59,149
I'm the first guy that
talked at the event today.

636
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,747
I talked about toothbrush,
this, that, the other thing.

637
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:03,453
And, in January I'll let you come

638
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:04,605
and spend a week with the team.

639
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:05,438
- [Ryan] Thank you sir.

640
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:06,271
- You're welcome.

641
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,104
- [Ryan] Thank you.

642
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:10,104
(audience applauds)

643
00:25:12,155 --> 00:25:13,418
- Mr. Gary sir thank you.

644
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:14,251
- [Gary] How are you doing?

645
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:15,266
- I am awesome.

646
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:16,349
- [Gary] Good man.

647
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:19,992
- I watched your video about
a year and a half ago or so,

648
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:23,588
and my channel has less
than 400 subscribers.

649
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,421
But I hit it with--

650
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:25,738
- [Gary] 400 more than zero.

651
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,125
- Yeah, that's true.

652
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,618
I hit it with depth,
'cause I heard you talkin'

653
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:30,450
about depth versus width.

654
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,783
And that alone allowed me to make

655
00:25:31,783 --> 00:25:34,541
over a quarter million
dollars just within my niche.

656
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,738
So, my question to you is--

657
00:25:36,738 --> 00:25:38,687
- And real quick, I'm gonna
stop you, I apologize.

658
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,547
This is super important.

659
00:25:40,547 --> 00:25:43,154
So many people are so caught up in width,

660
00:25:43,154 --> 00:25:45,450
and Eliah did a good job
and understood depth.

661
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,059
Like, there are so many people

662
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,317
that have so many more followers than me.

663
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:53,619
And their book comes out,
and they sell 1,000 copies.

664
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:57,228
Or, when they're the
headliner of a conference,

665
00:25:57,228 --> 00:25:59,364
half the people show up that is expected

666
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:01,068
'cause how many followers they have.

667
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:02,492
Which doesn't allow them to command

668
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:04,494
the price they want for speaking.

669
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:06,155
Or when they make merch,

670
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:08,964
'cause Logan and Jake are making a lot.

671
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:10,284
They sell a lot less.

672
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:11,756
Depth is massively important

673
00:26:11,756 --> 00:26:15,517
and the number one issue in this room

674
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:18,370
is the way you're taking
your audience for granted.

675
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,010
The amount of you that
I audited yesterday,

676
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,691
that have never replied to a comment,

677
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:25,215
in YouTube or Instagram,

678
00:26:25,215 --> 00:26:28,382
is baffling and utterly disappointing.

679
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,464
- [Man] Right on.

680
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,335
- Right on is right.

681
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:32,168
- [Man] Preach it brother.

682
00:26:32,168 --> 00:26:33,570
- It's real, you know.

683
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,711
Because at some level, you know,

684
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:38,261
it's one thing if you want
fame or the perception of fame

685
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:40,536
and that gets you off,
and like great, do it.

686
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:41,934
Then you should be about the numbers.

687
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,954
But so many of you here want
to pay your college debt off,

688
00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:46,616
or live the life that you want,

689
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:49,964
or make generational wealth
that your grandkids have.

690
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:51,558
It's gonna be about the depth.

691
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:55,202
Dude's got 400 fuckin'
subscribers, made $250,000.

692
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:57,396
Now maybe what he was selling
or have you is different,

693
00:26:57,396 --> 00:26:59,351
I get it, but that needs to be something

694
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,172
that people wrap their head around.

695
00:27:01,172 --> 00:27:02,436
I'm just stunned.

696
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:05,108
Like everyday, everyday I get
comments from people like,

697
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:06,453
"I can't believe you reply."

698
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:08,892
Or, "How much time you
put into your audience."

699
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:12,142
And every single time I
get that, I say to myself,

700
00:27:12,142 --> 00:27:15,475
I can't believe how much you guys don't.

701
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,155
- I just wanna say
again thank you so much.

702
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:20,342
Also some of the people that
I work with, my clients,

703
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:21,638
they are your followers too.

704
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:24,521
It'll be super awesome if I
could take a picture with you.

705
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:25,354
- [Gary] For sure.

706
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:26,187
- Would it be possible for me to come up

707
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,145
on the stage and do that?

708
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:27,978
- Sure.

709
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:28,811
- Thank you sir.

710
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:29,675
- You got it.

711
00:27:29,675 --> 00:27:32,675
(audience applauds)

712
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:35,836
- Thank you Gary.

713
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:37,586
- You're welcome bro.

714
00:27:38,794 --> 00:27:40,099
- Oh, gotta turn it around.

715
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:40,932
- I've heard.

716
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:42,055
(audience laughs)

717
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:45,001
- If you could press the
button for me? Thank you sir.

718
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:45,834
- Got it.

719
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:46,667
- Gary, thank you.

720
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:47,500
- Take care.

721
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,333
What's up my man?

722
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,479
- Gary my brother, thank you so much.

723
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,619
Consumed a lot of your content,

724
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:54,820
and it's really shaped a large portion

725
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,332
of how we're running
our business right now.

726
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:57,323
So, thank you.

727
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:58,192
- [Gary] You're welcome.

728
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:00,882
- My question, we are a
jump rope fitness company.

729
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:03,018
So you type in jump rope into YouTube,

730
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:04,334
jump rope, it's just all us.

731
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:05,671
We basically own that niche.

732
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:06,504
- [Gary] Love it, okay.

733
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:09,674
- And so, we're thinkin'
long term for a business.

734
00:28:09,674 --> 00:28:11,746
Are we better off, really,

735
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:12,834
we're already sellin' jump ropes,

736
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,273
so we basically own the information

737
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:16,231
around people who wanna buy jump ropes.

738
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:18,437
Should we keep going into
just selling jump ropes

739
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:21,047
and jump rope digital products?

740
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:25,323
Or, how do you feel
about brand integrations?

741
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:26,666
Advertising on our videos?

742
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:27,979
Like for us, sometimes for
us sometimes it feels like

743
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:28,812
let's turn advertisements off.

744
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:30,498
- I've got a great answer for you.

745
00:28:30,498 --> 00:28:31,647
Yeah, yeah I get it.

746
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:34,771
So, expansion is when brands get diluted.

747
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:36,699
So, for the first question
I would ask you is,

748
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:39,275
how much revenue is your
jump rope business doing?

749
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:43,231
And how big is the overall
jump rope business industry?

750
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:44,894
How long have you had the company?

751
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:45,727
- Two years.

752
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:47,792
- Right, my intuition
is you still don't have

753
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:51,310
a big enough portion
of the jump rope world.

754
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,224
And so probably there's
a lot more to expand

755
00:28:53,224 --> 00:28:55,188
before you go into other things.

756
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:57,148
But this is back to why I--

757
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:58,676
You know, I couldn't have gotten luckier

758
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:00,397
with the two questions in a row.

759
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,908
So cool, I just got off
my high horse of saying

760
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,524
I communicate with you and engage, right?

761
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:07,630
And like, made you feel
bad that you don't.

762
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:12,336
What's really scary is, I
do it 'cause I'm selfish.

763
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,325
The reason I engage with all of you

764
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:16,542
is 'cause I read everything you say

765
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:21,442
so that I can get better
insights to what to do next.

766
00:29:21,442 --> 00:29:23,532
So, your answer to your question,

767
00:29:23,532 --> 00:29:26,172
like I'm super smart, fine.

768
00:29:26,172 --> 00:29:27,983
Your community will tell you.

769
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,509
You just need to ask.

770
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:33,718
I mean it man, the answer is
literally in your comments.

771
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:36,246
You've just gotta take the
18 hours of fuckin' asking.

772
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:37,698
- Alright, appreciate
it brother thank you.

773
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:39,776
- [Gary] You got it, you got it.

774
00:29:39,776 --> 00:29:40,609
- Gary!

775
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:41,442
- [Gary] Yo!

776
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:42,275
- What's up man?

777
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:44,680
Danny Gould, Selling Silicon Valley.

778
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,169
We chatted at Relentless.

779
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:47,002
- [Gary] I remember.

780
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,939
- Yeah, I asked you the question,

781
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:53,080
on a macro scale how to drive
my real estate vlog, right?

782
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,846
- [Gary] I remember.

783
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:56,984
- But now I wanna ask you about the micro.

784
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,692
- [Gary] Okay.
- The local.

785
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:01,154
Because, for me right now,

786
00:30:01,154 --> 00:30:03,602
you know, obviously Silicon Valley.

787
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:06,693
Right, there's a lot of baby
boomers, a lot of older--

788
00:30:06,693 --> 00:30:07,779
- [Gary] I'm looking at
something to answer your question

789
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:08,903
so keep going.
- Yeah, totally.

790
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:10,623
A lot of older folks.

791
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:11,456
- [Gary] Yes.
- Right?

792
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,798
- [Gary] Yes.

793
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:14,958
- Who, obviously when you sell real estate

794
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,382
you have to list to last, right?

795
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:20,382
So getting these sellers
to engage with content,

796
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,900
or to viewing.

797
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,733
Right?

798
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:24,566
- [Gary] I'm listening.

799
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:27,816
- So, in terms of the older generation.

800
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,209
A lot of these people aren't
on some of these platforms

801
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:32,835
that we're talking about, right.

802
00:30:32,835 --> 00:30:33,668
- [Gary] Yup.

803
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:34,809
- So, how do I--

804
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:38,572
'Cause I'm comin' to you
because I've thought about this

805
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:40,061
for a long time.

806
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:42,069
How would you recommend--

807
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:43,716
- [Gary] Selling homes to older people?

808
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,645
- Well no, no, no.

809
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:47,812
Getting in front of these older people

810
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:50,027
on the digital platform.

811
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:54,086
- So look, he's generalizing,
don't beat him up.

812
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,416
(audience laughs)

813
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,742
- [Man] I know, but like, you know?

814
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:01,143
- So look, I think to both of your points,

815
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:01,976
you're both right.

816
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:02,893
He's right.

817
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:10,179
There is not a high usage of
60 to 80 year olds on Snapchat.

818
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:12,927
That's just real data, you know?

819
00:31:12,927 --> 00:31:14,744
And so, couple things.

820
00:31:14,744 --> 00:31:18,825
Number one, Facebook
does not have that issue.

821
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:21,010
When I look at conversion on Facebook,

822
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,380
55 to 70 year old conversions on Facebook

823
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,480
are just incredible.

824
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,254
There's so much attention,
there's so much scale.

825
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,558
They're going through it more carefully.

826
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,215
And I'm a very big fan.

827
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:36,254
So if you haven't run five mile radius's

828
00:31:36,254 --> 00:31:40,594
from your open houses on
Facebook to that demo,

829
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:44,265
of 50 to 75 year olds,
or 35 to 75 year olds,

830
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:47,342
with hundred thousand
income levels or greater.

831
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:49,264
Have you run Facebook ads
aggressively against that?

832
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:50,097
- [Danny] I have.

833
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:53,984
- So then, the issue is your creative.

834
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:55,016
You know, like I'm gonna
leave here right now

835
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:57,748
and go to a Berkshire
Hathaway real estate pitch

836
00:31:57,748 --> 00:31:59,672
for Vayner.
- [Danny] That's us.

837
00:31:59,672 --> 00:32:02,192
- And the data's very clear.

838
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:06,272
So, I think first you have
to look at your creative.

839
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:07,105
Right?

840
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:09,127
Like, is your creative hitting the note?

841
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,007
If you're in it, you know
the issue with real estate.

842
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:13,869
There's a lot of people at high net worth

843
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:15,566
that are gonna look at you and say

844
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,942
you're too young and
inexperienced and not go with you.

845
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:19,373
I lived it my whole life.

846
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:20,654
Now I'm finally going to the other side,

847
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:22,517
so it kinda fuckin' sucks but, you know.

848
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:24,100
(audience laughs)

849
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,183
I get it.

850
00:32:25,183 --> 00:32:26,176
I understand that.

851
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:27,512
So that's one thing to look at.

852
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,243
I'd also highly recommend you going

853
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:31,812
down the rabbit hole of Next Door.

854
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:33,011
So have you looked at Next Door?

855
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:33,844
- [Danny] I have yes.

856
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:36,907
- So I'm super intrigued by that platform

857
00:32:36,907 --> 00:32:38,519
from a real estate standpoint.

858
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,917
I think there's super
hardcore opportunity,

859
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:44,352
and then finally if I were you,

860
00:32:44,352 --> 00:32:45,926
I would do, the third thing is,

861
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:48,902
I would put 50% of my
energy, if you want them,

862
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:52,735
to go old school and
door to door direct mail.

863
00:32:54,403 --> 00:32:56,598
You know, just 'cause this is happening

864
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:59,340
doesn't mean we need to force
everybody into that behavior.

865
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,604
I never give a fuck what you're doing.

866
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:05,990
I'm just trying to figure
out what you're doing.

867
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,823
You know?

868
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:07,656
I don't have any horse in the race

869
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:10,628
whether you do VR, or
Snapchat or Vine, you know.

870
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:13,135
Q and I loved Vine, but then it changed.

871
00:33:13,135 --> 00:33:14,700
Like I don't know, it is what it is.

872
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,533
Fuck it.

873
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,546
So, I would spend a lot
more time in traditional

874
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:19,979
than you probably are.

875
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:21,026
- [Danny] Cool, thanks Gary.

876
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:23,217
- Cool, you got it.

877
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:24,112
Hey man.
- How's it going Gary?

878
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:25,002
- [Gary] Really well.

879
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,209
- So, when looking to dissect
a new social media platform

880
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,697
to figure out how to be successful,

881
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:31,881
what are some big picture
and practical tips

882
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:33,335
you can use to dissect that?

883
00:33:33,335 --> 00:33:34,704
- Big picture is I would download

884
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:36,387
every social network that appears

885
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:39,785
on the top 150 free apps
in America every time.

886
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:43,379
Create a user name, and start tasting it.

887
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:45,995
And then, micro picture is
start creating content for it

888
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:50,183
and use your other social
channels to drive people to it

889
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,824
to see what happens.

890
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:54,216
So like, how many people
here are trying to figure out

891
00:33:54,216 --> 00:33:56,881
what to do with Marco Polo?

892
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:57,839
You know?

893
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,823
Hey, so like, that's interesting.

894
00:33:59,823 --> 00:34:00,675
What is happening there?

895
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:01,946
How are you using it?

896
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:03,424
Can you get 50 of your users

897
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:05,567
to be part of a group with you there?

898
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,616
So, big picture Zane is like,

899
00:34:07,616 --> 00:34:08,743
literally wake up every morning

900
00:34:08,743 --> 00:34:11,636
and look at the top 150
apps in the app store.

901
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:13,643
Pick the three or four new social networks

902
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:15,464
that come every quarter, every year.

903
00:34:15,464 --> 00:34:17,382
Download them, create your account,

904
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:20,267
start making content and
then go to the channels

905
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:23,027
that you have audience
and drive them there,

906
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,139
and test and learn,.

907
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:28,310
Look, somebody landed here
eventually way back when

908
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:30,503
and looked at a bush
with some berries on it.

909
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:31,335
Right?

910
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,483
What was the strategy?

911
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:34,103
Somebody ate it.

912
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:36,934
Some dudes died, others
found strawberries.

913
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:39,592
(audience laughs)

914
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:42,381
And so that's what you have to
do with new social networks.

915
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:45,277
Social Cam took a lot of my time.

916
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:48,858
Social Cam took a lot of my time in 2011.

917
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:51,248
Anybody remember Social
Cam in that five minutes?

918
00:34:51,248 --> 00:34:52,081
Right?

919
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:52,914
Five minutes.

920
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:53,746
Right?

921
00:34:53,746 --> 00:34:57,106
It was number one, it was like the thing.

922
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:59,384
It came and went in like three months.

923
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:02,226
I put a lot of effort
to build audience there.

924
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,215
It failed, but what I learned

925
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:06,717
about mobile video on Social Cam,

926
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:08,869
became the reason that I
was able to be successful

927
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:11,429
at Vine, and Snapchat and Instagram.

928
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:13,444
And I wasn't even successful
as a creator on Vine.

929
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,276
I just got close to the
creators that were successful.

930
00:35:16,276 --> 00:35:19,935
But then, without that
Social Cam three months,

931
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:23,031
I wouldn't have had the IP
of the dynamics of video

932
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:25,271
in that environment to make me successful.

933
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:29,585
I highly recommend, so many of
you were in the no business.

934
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,679
I don't need another social network.

935
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,537
It's gonna take away
from what I'm focused on.

936
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:36,762
What if it goes in and
out of fashion fast?

937
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:38,209
What if it's the next Vine?

938
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:40,529
It doesn't matters.

939
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:42,073
What matters is the IP and the learning

940
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,950
and the land grab while it's there.

941
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,785
If Monkey is big for three
weeks, you can do damage there.

942
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:48,618
Got it?

943
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:52,126
That's the answer Zane.

944
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:53,032
- Hey Gary.
- Hey Jay.

945
00:35:53,032 --> 00:35:55,495
- Two things, one I saw you a
couple years ago in New York

946
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:57,350
and your fitness plan's workin'
for ya, you're lookin' good.

947
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,560
- [Gary] Thanks brother.

948
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,798
- Two is, I have run a digital
agency since I was young.

949
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:02,925
I started it when I was 17,

950
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:04,733
it's grown year over year for 20 years.

951
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,796
We cut our teeth on websites,

952
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:08,173
but I've got this gut
feeling that websites

953
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:09,968
are kinda becoming billboards.

954
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,237
And, so the last six to 12 months,

955
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:13,070
and we're in Northeast Florida--

956
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,755
- That being said, that being said Jay,

957
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,156
guys, actually it's
weird that you said that.

958
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:17,989
Yes, but.

959
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:22,035
I actually think one of
the biggest vulnerabilities

960
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,100
in this entire audience collectively,

961
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,628
is the lack of a proper website
collecting first party data

962
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:29,468
that you can re-market to.

963
00:36:29,468 --> 00:36:31,835
Everybody is living so,
on all these platforms,

964
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,406
they're not driving to their own domain

965
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:34,425
where they're capturing--

966
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,258
I mean, my email list does damage.

967
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:40,015
You know, it may not be
what email was years ago,

968
00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:41,545
but I've been trying to
make it better and better,

969
00:36:41,545 --> 00:36:42,378
and it sucked for awhile.

970
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:43,672
But now we've figured out, like fuck,

971
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:45,946
really give exclusive content,
like really make it good.

972
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:47,186
And it does damage.

973
00:36:47,186 --> 00:36:51,019
So yes, but ironically
the amount of people here

974
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:52,949
who should have a
Squarespace, or an about.me,

975
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:56,648
or build a Wordpress for
themselves, and own their url,

976
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:57,815
is quite high.

977
00:36:58,812 --> 00:36:59,645
- Yeah it's interesting,

978
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:01,032
so the website is kind
of still the hub for us

979
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:03,899
but we're working kinda building
the spokes outta the wheel.

980
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:06,505
And um, probably in the
last 12 months or so,

981
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:07,936
we've really started to pivot a lot harder

982
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:10,168
towards video, marketing, communication

983
00:37:10,168 --> 00:37:11,001
and all those kind of things.

984
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:12,193
A lot of it thanks to you.

985
00:37:12,193 --> 00:37:16,115
We're in Northeast Florida,
so technologically-wise,

986
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:17,824
it's not New York City,
it's not San Francisco.

987
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:18,808
It's that kinda thing.

988
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:21,242
So, if you're me, you've
got a 12 person team.

989
00:37:21,242 --> 00:37:23,656
You're growing, but you're
looking to the future.

990
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:24,604
Where are you going?

991
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:27,354
What are you focused on?
- Voice.

992
00:37:28,632 --> 00:37:29,465
- [Jay] Okay.

993
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:32,215
- If I started Vayner Media today,

994
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:34,024
I would call it Vayner Voice.

995
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:36,930
And we would be an Alexa,
Google Home, Apple Pod

996
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,554
and podcast infrastructure shop.

997
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:42,472
Voice is the next frontier.

998
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:43,591
- [Jay] Yeah, and I
just started a podcast--

999
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:47,341
- Video, is about to
get arbitraged by voice.

1000
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:51,388
Like some of your views
are about to go away.

1001
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:54,252
'Cause somebody's gonna
be listening to something.

1002
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:56,988
'Cause you can do two
things when you listen.

1003
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:59,712
- [Jay] Yeah, and I just started
a weekly podcast actually.

1004
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:01,538
Probably two months ago
thanks to that advice.

1005
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:02,546
So, we'll work on it.

1006
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:03,514
- I'm glad, I would go hardcore into that.

1007
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,736
- [Jay] Okay, cool thanks Gary.

1008
00:38:04,736 --> 00:38:06,734
- Take care Jay.

1009
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:07,582
- Hey Gary.

1010
00:38:07,582 --> 00:38:08,415
- [Gary] How are you?

1011
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:09,781
- I'm doing well thanks, how are you?

1012
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:10,614
- [Gary] Good, great.

1013
00:38:10,614 --> 00:38:11,447
- First of all, thank you for everything.

1014
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:12,340
I've been following you for awhile

1015
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,264
and I really appreciate it.

1016
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:15,852
I have a marketing company that I started

1017
00:38:15,852 --> 00:38:17,504
when I was much younger.

1018
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:18,337
Now we're doing web design--

1019
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,754
- [Gary] Were you six or?

1020
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:21,641
- About.
(audience laughs)

1021
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:23,895
We're actually working
with some Fortune 500s now,

1022
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:25,478
so we're growing and,

1023
00:38:25,478 --> 00:38:26,855
yeah you know one of our service lines

1024
00:38:26,855 --> 00:38:28,406
that's been really profitable for us

1025
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,078
and we have a high retention rate on

1026
00:38:30,078 --> 00:38:31,694
is reputation management.

1027
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:33,622
So I know there are some
big players out there,

1028
00:38:33,622 --> 00:38:35,507
and we're going up against them now.

1029
00:38:35,507 --> 00:38:37,242
But our retention rate is crazy high,

1030
00:38:37,242 --> 00:38:40,599
we're very effective at what
we do, and we're scaleable.

1031
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:41,730
We've built it out in a way,

1032
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,268
so my question for you is,

1033
00:38:43,268 --> 00:38:45,689
I'm really looking for ways to grow

1034
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:49,229
large quantities and scale
as big as fast as possible.

1035
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:50,294
- [Gary] Why?

1036
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,313
- Because we're growing
year by year already,

1037
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:54,151
and I wanna see how big I can take this,

1038
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:56,214
and how quickly I can take
it as big as possible.

1039
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:57,431
- [Gary] Well, let me ask you a question.

1040
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:58,264
- Yeah.

1041
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:00,615
- The only way you can do
that is either raise money.

1042
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:01,448
- [Man] Okay.

1043
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:04,933
- Or, start taking a lot
less money personally.

1044
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:05,975
- [Man] Okay.

1045
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:07,646
Well I've already started on the second.

1046
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:08,479
- Good.

1047
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,477
- But as far as investors,
I've been approached before,

1048
00:39:10,477 --> 00:39:12,773
but I'm looking for a
more strategic investor.

1049
00:39:12,773 --> 00:39:14,501
Someone who would know
what to do in this space.

1050
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:16,581
And most people are, you
know people in real estate,

1051
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:18,981
or family who see the opportunity,

1052
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,783
but they won't be able to really help me.

1053
00:39:20,783 --> 00:39:22,011
- Smart money.

1054
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:23,188
You want smart money.

1055
00:39:23,188 --> 00:39:24,220
- [Man] Are you looking to invest?

1056
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,382
- I'm not.
- [Man] Okay.

1057
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:26,215
(audience laughs)

1058
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:27,876
I had to ask.

1059
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:28,860
- You gotta ask, right?

1060
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,943
- [Man] Yeah.

1061
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:32,927
- Look, I think you need to
decide between smart money

1062
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:34,591
and passive money.

1063
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:37,039
I'm gonna give you a really
good piece of advice.

1064
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,335
In 2001 and two, when I lived
through the business world,

1065
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:42,208
and in 2007, six and eight,

1066
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,886
when I lived through the business world,

1067
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:46,846
I had a lot of friends that
were looking for smart money.

1068
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:48,173
And then the market crashed,

1069
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:49,141
and they were looking for money

1070
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:52,158
and there was none to be had.

1071
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:53,326
Just keep that in mind.

1072
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:54,159
- Okay.

1073
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,121
What would you do with the money?

1074
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,318
Where would be the avenues you would hit?

1075
00:39:57,318 --> 00:39:59,000
- I don't know, it's your
fuckin' business bro.

1076
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,239
(audience laughs)

1077
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,592
Like all I heard from you

1078
00:40:01,592 --> 00:40:03,824
is you wanna get bigger faster, sooner.

1079
00:40:03,824 --> 00:40:05,553
I asked why, because I think usually

1080
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:09,599
when people's agenda is
to get bigger, faster.

1081
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,734
I usually know that they're in trouble.

1082
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:15,951
The way to get bigger is to go slower.

1083
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:16,910
- [Man] Alright, thank you.

1084
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:17,993
- You got it.

1085
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,390
I just expand on that?

1086
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,398
Just 'cause, not to leave
him with like a change.

1087
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:23,824
You know?

1088
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:24,847
Everybody's in such a ru--

1089
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:25,743
You know how young?

1090
00:40:25,743 --> 00:40:27,743
Al, how old are you bro?

1091
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:30,077
- [Al] 27.

1092
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:30,910
- How old?

1093
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,743
- [Al] 27!

1094
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:34,244
- That's the thing, right?

1095
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:37,061
To me, his advantage is his youth.

1096
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:40,255
Which should allow him
to go slower, not faster.

1097
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:42,499
And I get it, everybody wants to win.

1098
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:43,789
I get it.

1099
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:46,219
But, I know one thing
that you guys hear from me

1100
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:48,835
more than most people talk
about it, is patience.

1101
00:40:48,835 --> 00:40:51,449
I know it's the secret sauce.

1102
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,396
Life is long, and when
you wanna get bigger

1103
00:40:54,396 --> 00:40:56,316
for the sake of bigger,

1104
00:40:56,316 --> 00:41:00,851
you start taking shortcuts
that lead to vulnerabilities.

1105
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:03,985
So I just would keep that in mind.

1106
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:04,818
Hi.

1107
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:05,793
- Hey Gary, aloha.

1108
00:41:05,793 --> 00:41:07,516
It's an honor to be here.
- [Gary] Thank you.

1109
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:08,428
- Thank you for what you do.

1110
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:11,041
So, I'm a complete newbie to this space.

1111
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:14,729
I was one of the 98%, I just
hopped on about two months ago.

1112
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:15,747
- [Gary] Cool.

1113
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:17,859
- My audience that I serve,

1114
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:20,300
or I wish to serve are
entrepreneurs who like me,

1115
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,144
who struggled to get started.

1116
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:26,464
And so I'm building that
group in these platforms.

1117
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:30,897
And, I don't really have much,
I'm building Instagram first.

1118
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:32,804
And then from there,
then my offer would be,

1119
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:34,686
whether I'm affiliate marketing something

1120
00:41:34,686 --> 00:41:36,358
or selling courses and whatnot.

1121
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:38,263
So that's sort of my vision right now.

1122
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,110
Where I'm also building
network marketing companies

1123
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:43,023
'cause I do like network marketing.

1124
00:41:43,023 --> 00:41:44,495
- [Gary] Why?

1125
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:47,275
- It's just leverage, I
don't know, it's for fun.

1126
00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:48,108
- [Gary] Okay.

1127
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,979
- I mean, what are your thoughts on that?

1128
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,151
- Not as much as I'm saying.

1129
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:51,984
- [Woman] Okay.

1130
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:53,659
- But you know, just
one man's point of view.

1131
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:54,771
Just curious why.

1132
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:56,012
I think the reason you like it,

1133
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:59,095
is 'cause there's quicker dollars in.

1134
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:01,651
- Right now there's no dollars at all.

1135
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:02,484
(audience laughs)

1136
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:05,234
I think I like, I don't know,

1137
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:07,017
it's just an interesting little challenge

1138
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:07,850
to see if we can actually
grow an organization.

1139
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,438
- [Gary] Respect, do your thing.

1140
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:11,907
Look, I think when somebody decides

1141
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,657
to get into content and creative,

1142
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:18,351
and already before they've started,

1143
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:20,994
they are thinking about the monetization

1144
00:42:20,994 --> 00:42:23,616
of affiliate or network,
or things of that nature,

1145
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:25,366
you're setup to fail.

1146
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,866
And, so what I would tell you
to do if I had the chance,

1147
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:33,695
which I do, is to take a step back,

1148
00:42:33,695 --> 00:42:36,040
and realize, you know,

1149
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,339
creating content to
motivate people to start

1150
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:40,922
is a crowded space.

1151
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:46,153
A forever space, because
people don't act, I get it.

1152
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:48,499
But, what I'm worried about as a newbie,

1153
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,082
is this is such a cliché story.

1154
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:53,542
Right?

1155
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:54,559
I'm gonna build an audience,

1156
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,580
and I'm gonna monetize it, for me.

1157
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,336
And what happens is, before you start,

1158
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:03,335
you're thinking about monetization.

1159
00:43:03,335 --> 00:43:06,099
Like how will it happen when it happens?

1160
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:08,733
What that does is
something very interesting.

1161
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:11,816
It creates the wrong kind of content.

1162
00:43:12,811 --> 00:43:16,377
When the seed is about
long term monetization,

1163
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:20,256
the seed is corroded, and
there's an element of that

1164
00:43:20,256 --> 00:43:21,964
in all of the content.

1165
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:24,732
No question my biggest
advantage in the marketplace

1166
00:43:24,732 --> 00:43:27,804
is the lack of interest
of monetizing my audience.

1167
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:31,044
You need to think about that.

1168
00:43:31,044 --> 00:43:32,918
- Is there another angle I
should be looking at this

1169
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:34,232
coming into this?

1170
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:36,943
- Yeah, I think the angle is to blindly

1171
00:43:36,943 --> 00:43:38,686
try to bring value to the audience

1172
00:43:38,686 --> 00:43:41,088
whether it's information or entertainment.

1173
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:43,848
And then wake up in six years
and start to then debate

1174
00:43:43,848 --> 00:43:45,350
what the fuck to do with it.

1175
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,856
- [Woman] Got it, okay,
okay thank you very much.

1176
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:48,689
- You're welcome.

1177
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:49,522
- [Woman] I'll have to get on that.

1178
00:43:49,522 --> 00:43:51,425
Thank you, aloha.

1179
00:43:51,425 --> 00:43:52,983
- Hey Gary, so I've been watching you

1180
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:55,055
for about six months now.

1181
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:57,247
But over the last year and a half

1182
00:43:57,247 --> 00:43:58,349
I've been building an Instagram

1183
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:00,334
and I've got about half
a million followers.

1184
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:02,229
But since I've been watching you,

1185
00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:04,390
I've seen probably a triple in growth

1186
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,693
just from implementing different things.

1187
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:08,974
I've just kinda put you
on my nightstand at night

1188
00:44:08,974 --> 00:44:10,336
and I just kinda listen to you.

1189
00:44:10,336 --> 00:44:12,447
- [Gary] Thank you man, happy to be there.

1190
00:44:12,447 --> 00:44:13,991
(audience laughs)

1191
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:14,950
- So it's really exciting for me--

1192
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:15,886
- It's better than yesterday guys,

1193
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,430
like "Listen, I listen to you all the time

1194
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,414
"when I'm in the shower."

1195
00:44:18,414 --> 00:44:19,382
I'm like, cool.

1196
00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:20,510
(audience laughs)

1197
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,247
- No, I can say I haven't done that yet.

1198
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:24,851
But what I really wanted to ask you

1199
00:44:24,851 --> 00:44:26,499
is I've been building this platform

1200
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,112
'cause I'm a firm believer
that you have to have

1201
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:30,275
an audience to hear you, and I'm a singer.

1202
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:32,196
Before you release something,

1203
00:44:32,196 --> 00:44:33,431
if you really want to create momentum.

1204
00:44:33,431 --> 00:44:36,005
- I agree, it's momentum,

1205
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:38,102
but more importantly
you know, it's leverage.

1206
00:44:38,102 --> 00:44:39,572
- Yeah, and that's what
we're kinda going for

1207
00:44:39,572 --> 00:44:41,562
because we know you
can go into labels now.

1208
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:43,509
And I feel confident if we went now

1209
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:45,012
we wouldn't get as good a deal

1210
00:44:45,012 --> 00:44:47,589
as if we went in with
the leverage like that.

1211
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:49,470
- You know what's happening
in the hip-hop space right?

1212
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,901
Put out projects, put out mix tapes,

1213
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:52,561
have leverage, have millions of followers,

1214
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:55,133
and then get the kind of
deal that you think you want.

1215
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:58,026
By the way, you might be
the last of the Mohicans

1216
00:44:58,026 --> 00:45:00,787
that even give a shit to even have a deal.

1217
00:45:00,787 --> 00:45:03,092
- And that's kinda, my
manager is in the audience,

1218
00:45:03,092 --> 00:45:04,267
I actually told him, you know,

1219
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:06,220
I wanna live everyday thinking

1220
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,967
that I'm not going to get a
deal at the end of the day.

1221
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:09,800
You know what I mean?

1222
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,633
- [Gary] So do that.

1223
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:12,223
- And that's kind of the game plan.

1224
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:14,371
- That's not fully where
you're at right now.

1225
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:17,087
- No, but coming into this time and season

1226
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:18,576
where I'm releasing my first single.

1227
00:45:18,576 --> 00:45:20,111
What would be your strategy?

1228
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:21,799
'Cause I'm heavy on Instagram,

1229
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:23,744
I'm not so much on Facebook and YouTube,

1230
00:45:23,744 --> 00:45:24,577
and I'm branching out.

1231
00:45:24,577 --> 00:45:25,983
I started doing that about a month ago.

1232
00:45:25,983 --> 00:45:28,792
- Do you have a Spotify
and SoundCloud now?

1233
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,112
- I don't have either
account really set up.

1234
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:32,096
This is a first time go at it.

1235
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,251
- Well that's fuckin' crazy.

1236
00:45:33,251 --> 00:45:34,084
- But yeah.

1237
00:45:34,084 --> 00:45:35,222
- You need to do that.

1238
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:36,055
Right?

1239
00:45:36,055 --> 00:45:37,483
And start populating it.

1240
00:45:37,483 --> 00:45:39,605
You know one thing that I
think is really interesting,

1241
00:45:39,605 --> 00:45:43,605
is populating an artist's
SoundCloud and Spotify

1242
00:45:44,646 --> 00:45:47,574
with content of them
speaking about their thoughts

1243
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:50,151
before they launch their first song.

1244
00:45:50,151 --> 00:45:52,049
And then you can start siphoning--

1245
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,326
You know, because think about it.

1246
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:54,886
You're building this
audience on Instagram.

1247
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,054
How many are on Instagram now?

1248
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:56,902
- [Singer] About half a million.

1249
00:45:56,902 --> 00:45:57,735
- Right.

1250
00:45:57,735 --> 00:45:59,335
So, come three months from now, tomorrow,

1251
00:45:59,335 --> 00:46:00,483
whenever it drops.

1252
00:46:00,483 --> 00:46:01,343
It's gonna be the first time

1253
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:03,739
you're gonna ask that
audience to go over there.

1254
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:05,072
Whereas if you had three or four months

1255
00:46:05,072 --> 00:46:06,816
of getting them to go over there

1256
00:46:06,816 --> 00:46:08,290
with the journey of your mindset

1257
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,921
before the launch of the first album,

1258
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:12,370
you'll have a much bigger base

1259
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,352
that will create virality
instantaneously for you

1260
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:17,338
when you drop the song there.

1261
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:18,171
- So you think that--

1262
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:19,918
- The big thing I did with Crush It,

1263
00:46:19,918 --> 00:46:21,376
that was very unusual, I apologize,

1264
00:46:21,376 --> 00:46:22,924
but I wanna give this to everybody.

1265
00:46:22,924 --> 00:46:24,368
The big thing I did with Crush It

1266
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:27,969
that was super unusual
for booksellers in 2008

1267
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:31,310
was I pre-sold it for four
months before it came out.

1268
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,546
The conventional wisdom back then was

1269
00:46:33,546 --> 00:46:35,640
you have your blowout week, right?

1270
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,496
You go on the Today Show,
and Huffington Post,

1271
00:46:37,496 --> 00:46:39,592
and you push and you email.

1272
00:46:39,592 --> 00:46:42,104
And I asked one question
in my early meeting

1273
00:46:42,104 --> 00:46:43,968
with Harper Collins, which was,

1274
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:48,172
do all the sales count if I
get 'em in pre-order on Amazon

1275
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,830
that week I get them?

1276
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,162
Or, the week the book comes out?

1277
00:46:51,162 --> 00:46:52,646
And they go, The week the book comes out.

1278
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:54,881
So like one more time, so
if I get eight this week

1279
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:57,762
and 19 next week, and 47 next week...

1280
00:46:57,762 --> 00:46:58,595
They're like yeah, it all counts.

1281
00:46:58,595 --> 00:46:59,865
So I'm like, why don't people do that?

1282
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:02,097
Because we lived in a traditional world

1283
00:47:02,097 --> 00:47:04,732
of you go on television
and you get your orders.

1284
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:07,323
That's how I'm thinking about you.

1285
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:09,913
I know that artists now don't turn

1286
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:12,441
their SoundCloud or Spotify into a podcast

1287
00:47:12,441 --> 00:47:15,161
for three months before the first song.

1288
00:47:15,161 --> 00:47:17,915
Which is exactly why
it's a good fuckin' idea.

1289
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:18,748
- [Singer] Yeah I was gonna say,

1290
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:20,345
I've never seen that
done on Spotify before.

1291
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:21,596
But I've seen it done on SoundCloud--

1292
00:47:21,596 --> 00:47:23,469
- No that's the shit
I do, we make shit up.

1293
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:24,761
(audience laughs)

1294
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,057
- [Singer] That's what I've
been doin' for a few months

1295
00:47:26,057 --> 00:47:27,537
and that's how I came
up with my viral video

1296
00:47:27,537 --> 00:47:28,881
for fuckin' content and now--

1297
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:30,665
- 100%, so that's what I would do.

1298
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:31,498
- Cool, thank you.

1299
00:47:31,498 --> 00:47:33,721
- You're welcome.

1300
00:47:33,721 --> 00:47:34,554
- Hey Gary.
- Hey man.

1301
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:36,020
- I'm with a small agency,

1302
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,395
and we spend a lot of our time

1303
00:47:37,395 --> 00:47:40,003
trying to think of
industries and verticals

1304
00:47:40,003 --> 00:47:43,074
that we wanna get in
on the ground level of.

1305
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:44,030
And I know you're on voice right now,

1306
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,796
and you're talkin' about that a lot.

1307
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,142
But going through about a year and a half

1308
00:47:47,142 --> 00:47:48,134
worth of your content,

1309
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:49,774
you've mentioned eSports a lot.

1310
00:47:49,774 --> 00:47:50,607
- I'm a fan.

1311
00:47:50,607 --> 00:47:52,303
- But, I wanted to get your opinion

1312
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,901
on what do you think of eSports

1313
00:47:53,901 --> 00:47:55,343
from a marketing standpoint?

1314
00:47:55,343 --> 00:47:57,144
And also from a VC standpoint?

1315
00:47:57,144 --> 00:48:00,030
- I think from a VC standpoint
it's super dangerous

1316
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,902
because there's a lot
of bullshit out there.

1317
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:04,784
And I think that the IP
game makers and the players

1318
00:48:04,784 --> 00:48:05,904
have the leverage.

1319
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:07,266
And there's a lot of
people building businesses

1320
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:08,760
in between that are gonna be vulnerable.

1321
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,832
Unless they're run by
very talented people.

1322
00:48:10,832 --> 00:48:14,704
And they'll be not as valuable
as they're being priced.

1323
00:48:14,704 --> 00:48:15,584
From a marketing standpoint

1324
00:48:15,584 --> 00:48:17,773
I think it's grossly
under-priced attention.

1325
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:19,153
And that brand should spend a fuckload

1326
00:48:19,153 --> 00:48:21,026
more money on eSports.

1327
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:25,193
- Do you see a possibility
of an outside marketing firm

1328
00:48:26,743 --> 00:48:28,103
partnering with an eSports team

1329
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:29,414
and just doing all their content?

1330
00:48:29,414 --> 00:48:30,935
Or do you think it has to be in house?

1331
00:48:30,935 --> 00:48:33,811
- 100%, no I think if you
guys are debating eSports

1332
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:35,927
as a place to go hard at,

1333
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:38,271
it will become fruitful for
you if you're good at it.

1334
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:39,104
- [Bald Man] Alright, thanks man.

1335
00:48:39,104 --> 00:48:39,937
- You got it.

1336
00:48:39,937 --> 00:48:41,153
- [Bald Man] Real quick
shout-out to D-Rock.

1337
00:48:41,153 --> 00:48:41,986
- D-Rock.

1338
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:42,976
- [Audience] D-Rock!

1339
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:44,175
(audience chuckles)

1340
00:48:44,175 --> 00:48:45,224
- D-Rock!

1341
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:46,393
- Hey Gary, how's it goin'?

1342
00:48:46,393 --> 00:48:47,960
- It is going super well bro.

1343
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,857
- Well nice to meet
you, I am Parker Panel.

1344
00:48:49,857 --> 00:48:50,690
- Hey Parker.

1345
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,184
- I just turned 14 years old,

1346
00:48:52,184 --> 00:48:53,484
and when you were my age,

1347
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:57,365
what were you doing to make
money and really crush it?

1348
00:48:57,365 --> 00:48:58,253
(audience laughs)

1349
00:48:58,253 --> 00:48:59,565
- What grade are you in?

1350
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:00,653
- [Parker] Eighth grade.

1351
00:49:00,653 --> 00:49:03,509
- So in eighth grade I started

1352
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:07,016
my first real, real, real business.

1353
00:49:07,016 --> 00:49:09,752
In eighth grade I was making
$1,000 to $2,000 a weekend

1354
00:49:09,752 --> 00:49:11,760
once a month selling baseball cards

1355
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,753
in the malls of New Jersey.

1356
00:49:13,753 --> 00:49:14,586
- [Parker] Awesome.

1357
00:49:14,586 --> 00:49:15,778
- 'Cause I don't know
if you know this bro,

1358
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:17,573
but there was no internet when I was 14.

1359
00:49:17,573 --> 00:49:19,652
(audience laughs)

1360
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:21,069
And so, you know,

1361
00:49:21,966 --> 00:49:24,173
it's real fuckin' easy
for you to make money.

1362
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:27,090
It was much harder for us old folk.

1363
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,301
But we got by.

1364
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:30,584
- [Parker] Awesome, awesome.

1365
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:31,993
Well thank you so much.

1366
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:32,826
- Before you leave bro.

1367
00:49:32,826 --> 00:49:33,659
- [Parker] Ooh, yeah?

1368
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:35,281
- What are you trying to do?

1369
00:49:35,281 --> 00:49:36,737
- Well you know, I'm an actor,

1370
00:49:36,737 --> 00:49:38,426
and I started my YouTube channel,

1371
00:49:38,426 --> 00:49:40,729
a few days ago was my one year.

1372
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:42,259
And I do a bunch of comedy videos,

1373
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:44,050
and my family, my dad's over there.

1374
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:44,970
He's videoing.

1375
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,803
- [Gary] What up, dad?

1376
00:49:45,803 --> 00:49:46,636
Good to see you man.

1377
00:49:46,636 --> 00:49:47,469
- And we travel all the time,

1378
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:48,579
so were just in Dubai in the Maldives,

1379
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:50,178
and I videoed my adventures there.

1380
00:49:50,178 --> 00:49:51,891
And I really want to entertain people

1381
00:49:51,891 --> 00:49:53,819
so they can get out and
kinda do what you do

1382
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:57,650
and really change the world and
motivate them in a good way.

1383
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,106
- Good for you brother, I wish you luck.

1384
00:49:59,106 --> 00:49:59,939
- Thank you so much.

1385
00:49:59,939 --> 00:50:00,772
- Take care.

1386
00:50:00,772 --> 00:50:03,772
(audience applauds)

1387
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,403
- So I feel terrible
to have to follow that.

1388
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:08,236
Thanks Parker.

1389
00:50:08,236 --> 00:50:09,420
(audience laughs)

1390
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,752
- [Gary] Yeah, you're fucked Roberto.

1391
00:50:11,752 --> 00:50:14,137
- Pretty much, like
what else is new right?

1392
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:15,033
So how's it goin' Gary?

1393
00:50:15,033 --> 00:50:16,106
- [Gary] Really well,
it's good to see you.

1394
00:50:16,106 --> 00:50:17,017
- Good to see you man.

1395
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:19,830
So, for context I'm a
creative entrepreneur

1396
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,366
and a lot of what I do on YouTube

1397
00:50:21,366 --> 00:50:23,954
is I try to help people
not be starving artists.

1398
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,074
I try to walk them through
what I did that worked,

1399
00:50:26,074 --> 00:50:27,593
what I did that didn't.

1400
00:50:27,593 --> 00:50:29,528
Why it sucks sometimes,

1401
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:31,218
and my question to you right now

1402
00:50:31,218 --> 00:50:32,523
is for all of those people.

1403
00:50:32,523 --> 00:50:35,169
It's what do you see
being the disproportionate

1404
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:37,891
vulnerability for creatives
and creative entrepreneurs?

1405
00:50:37,891 --> 00:50:38,783
'Cause right now I know you're doing

1406
00:50:38,783 --> 00:50:40,407
your Vayner Creative Initiative.

1407
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:42,239
You're somebody who is
in the hiring chair.

1408
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,919
So for all the creatives out there,

1409
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:45,951
for all the people whether
they're a YouTube or Snapchat,

1410
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:47,202
or whether they're drawing.

1411
00:50:47,202 --> 00:50:49,250
Like what do you think right now--

1412
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,083
- Is the big vulnerability?

1413
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:50,916
- [Roberto] Is the big vulnerability?

1414
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:52,343
What are they underestimating?

1415
00:50:52,343 --> 00:50:56,052
- That they're not good at business.

1416
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,151
- [Roberto] That pretty much sums it up.

1417
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
But, beyond--

1418
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,063
(audience laughs)

1419
00:50:59,063 --> 00:51:00,727
- I mean the biggest
vulnerability Roberto,

1420
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:04,311
is that some people are
such extreme just artists

1421
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,865
that they don't have the humility

1422
00:51:05,865 --> 00:51:08,288
in the face of entrepreneurship being cool

1423
00:51:08,288 --> 00:51:10,672
to team up and have a partner

1424
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:14,294
who can drive the actual business.

1425
00:51:14,294 --> 00:51:15,597
- [Roberto] So ultimately your answer is,

1426
00:51:15,597 --> 00:51:17,475
they need to either want
to invest some time again

1427
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:19,050
getting this if they have the potential

1428
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:19,907
that they haven't tapped.

1429
00:51:19,907 --> 00:51:21,011
Or outsourcing because it's weakness.

1430
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,283
- You know me well, we've
known each other a long time.

1431
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:27,050
I only think that I can get
only incrementally better

1432
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,869
at swimming, and singing and painting.

1433
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:33,300
Entrepreneurship is so cool right now,

1434
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,563
and such a pedestal, and
has no cost of entry.

1435
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:39,714
Every person here can
put the word entrepreneur

1436
00:51:39,714 --> 00:51:41,964
in their Instagram profile.

1437
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,226
I'm aware.

1438
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,482
And there's just a fundamental difference

1439
00:51:46,482 --> 00:51:48,611
between a successful entrepreneur

1440
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:50,778
and somebody who says they are.

1441
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:51,802
And there's a lot of people here

1442
00:51:51,802 --> 00:51:54,202
that are unbelievable creatives,

1443
00:51:54,202 --> 00:51:57,494
who will lose because they're
spending disproportionate time

1444
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:59,862
trying to be good at something
that will never happen.

1445
00:51:59,862 --> 00:52:02,022
Instead of putting 100% of their effort

1446
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:03,630
in the creative process.

1447
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,857
The fact that we're blending--

1448
00:52:04,857 --> 00:52:06,997
Listen, there's people like Shonduras,

1449
00:52:06,997 --> 00:52:08,655
who is absolutely, and the reason I

1450
00:52:08,655 --> 00:52:10,620
attach to him and always
give him mentorship.

1451
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,220
I'm like cool, this guy's
creative and an entrepreneur.

1452
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,116
But there's a lot of people in here

1453
00:52:15,116 --> 00:52:16,744
who want to be an entrepreneur.

1454
00:52:16,744 --> 00:52:17,940
And there's a lot of entrepreneurs in here

1455
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,676
that want to be a creator.

1456
00:52:19,676 --> 00:52:21,742
And that is the vulnerability.

1457
00:52:21,742 --> 00:52:23,500
The lack of self-awareness,

1458
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,942
and the utter delusion in what they want

1459
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,748
instead of what is real.

1460
00:52:28,748 --> 00:52:29,980
- [Roberto] Boom.

1461
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,596
(audience laughs)

1462
00:52:31,596 --> 00:52:32,429
Thanks Gary.

1463
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,012
- Great to see you.

1464
00:52:36,007 --> 00:52:36,840
- Hi Gary.

1465
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,673
- Hi.

1466
00:52:37,673 --> 00:52:38,551
- I'm Sarah Beth, from Sarah Beth Yoga,

1467
00:52:38,551 --> 00:52:41,120
and I used to be all about that hustle.

1468
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,788
I used to work 80 hour weeks,

1469
00:52:42,788 --> 00:52:45,871
and happily would work 80 hour weeks.

1470
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:48,739
So I guess my issue now is that,

1471
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:50,838
so I have a kid and I
have another on the way,

1472
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:54,885
and so I'm much more focused
on my time management.

1473
00:52:54,885 --> 00:52:55,983
Earlier you mentioned like, you know,

1474
00:52:55,983 --> 00:52:57,027
"When you say you don't have time."

1475
00:52:57,027 --> 00:53:00,997
Like, I don't really
have the time anymore.

1476
00:53:00,997 --> 00:53:03,481
So I was purposeful
about staying on YouTube

1477
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:04,585
and Facebook and Instagram.

1478
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:05,418
- [Gary] I get it.

1479
00:53:05,418 --> 00:53:08,253
- But I hear you about expanding my brand,

1480
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:10,093
and reaching out to other platforms.

1481
00:53:10,093 --> 00:53:11,084
How?

1482
00:53:11,084 --> 00:53:12,623
- Look I think, I'm very empathetic.

1483
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:16,039
Look, even if you're the
greatest hustler that ever lived,

1484
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:16,975
I don't know if you've heard,

1485
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:19,636
it's still only 24 hours in a day, right?

1486
00:53:19,636 --> 00:53:22,479
So, here's what I would say Sarah.

1487
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:27,065
I would say that there's
nothing wrong with staying deep

1488
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:30,611
on Facebook and Google platforms.

1489
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:34,374
Facebook and Google
rule the digital world.

1490
00:53:34,374 --> 00:53:37,174
And, there's nothing even remotely close

1491
00:53:37,174 --> 00:53:40,099
that's happening that is
gonna change that narrative

1492
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:44,883
for the next 24 to 48
months intuitively, right?

1493
00:53:44,883 --> 00:53:47,090
In a world where you
have your second coming,

1494
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,969
and all those things that
are going on in your life,

1495
00:53:48,969 --> 00:53:52,529
I'm not so desperate for you to have to

1496
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,138
do other things right now.

1497
00:53:54,138 --> 00:53:57,065
Knowing that Instagram,
Facebook and YouTube

1498
00:53:57,065 --> 00:53:58,753
are going nowhere fast, right?

1499
00:53:58,753 --> 00:53:59,650
- [Sarah] Right.

1500
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,706
- I think when I say to a
lot of people in this room,

1501
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,789
you know, find more time.

1502
00:54:05,774 --> 00:54:09,941
As long as your ambition is
in check to your actions,

1503
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:12,361
you're good, right?

1504
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:13,699
You wanna be the best mom you can be,

1505
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:16,352
you wanna be a creator, you
wanna be an entrepreneur.

1506
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:17,305
That's awesome.

1507
00:54:17,305 --> 00:54:19,193
The biggest rub that I have is

1508
00:54:19,193 --> 00:54:20,202
you have a lot of people saying

1509
00:54:20,202 --> 00:54:23,019
that they're gonna build
billion dollar empires

1510
00:54:23,019 --> 00:54:25,228
and they're working nine hours a day.

1511
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,026
And that's not gonna map.

1512
00:54:27,026 --> 00:54:27,859
Right?

1513
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:29,513
So it's not that I want
you to spend more time.

1514
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:31,596
As long you're like, hey,

1515
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:33,879
my ambition is to make--

1516
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:36,838
It's hard if you're gonna mother

1517
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:39,279
and not outsource that
to a full time nanny

1518
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:40,598
to have the time and energy

1519
00:54:40,598 --> 00:54:43,521
to build $100 million media
company around yourself.

1520
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:44,785
It's gonna be hard.

1521
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:46,823
As long as you're cool
and understand like hey,

1522
00:54:46,823 --> 00:54:48,975
maybe that's a million
instead of $100 million.

1523
00:54:48,975 --> 00:54:51,678
Because rightfully, you're
choosing to allocate

1524
00:54:51,678 --> 00:54:54,599
raising your wonderful
children, then you're good.

1525
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:57,691
It's the delusion that I'm worried about.

1526
00:54:57,691 --> 00:55:01,969
It's that people's mouths are
way ahead of their actions.

1527
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:02,802
Got it?

1528
00:55:02,802 --> 00:55:03,635
- [Sarah] Yeah, thank you.

1529
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,700
- You're welcome.

1530
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,675
- Hey Gary.

1531
00:55:06,675 --> 00:55:07,508
- Hey bro.

1532
00:55:07,508 --> 00:55:08,347
- How's your day been?

1533
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:09,873
- Doing really good CJ, how are you?

1534
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:10,774
- I'm good.

1535
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,941
Okay, so I just turned 13.

1536
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:18,936
I've been doing YouTube
for about two years.

1537
00:55:18,936 --> 00:55:22,034
And the first year I didn't
really get anything done.

1538
00:55:22,034 --> 00:55:23,393
But up until this summer--

1539
00:55:23,393 --> 00:55:25,056
- [Gary] Get anything done
as in didn't get traction?

1540
00:55:25,056 --> 00:55:27,753
Or you were bullshitting
playing video games?

1541
00:55:27,753 --> 00:55:28,586
Both of them.

1542
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:29,419
- Both of them.

1543
00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:32,134
(audience laughs)

1544
00:55:32,134 --> 00:55:35,201
- But then this summer, I
started to get more like,

1545
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:39,118
I quit video games and
I got a better view time

1546
00:55:41,225 --> 00:55:45,167
and attraction, but I'm still
like, I'm at 142 right now.

1547
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,206
So I'm wondering like,

1548
00:55:46,206 --> 00:55:48,590
what's one tip you have for kids my age?

1549
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,120
- [Gary] 142 meaning what?

1550
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,685
- 142 subs.

1551
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:54,646
- Got it, so what do
you want to happen CJ?

1552
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:59,052
- I just want to get at least
300 by the end of the year.

1553
00:55:59,052 --> 00:56:01,532
- Okay, well first of all,
we'll take care of that.

1554
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:04,540
(audience laughs)

1555
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,373
Right?

1556
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:07,588
So like, now what?

1557
00:56:07,588 --> 00:56:09,356
- [CJ] Just to inspire people.

1558
00:56:09,356 --> 00:56:11,580
- Good, so if you want to inspire people,

1559
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,108
that's real, right?

1560
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:15,332
If that's really what you're about?

1561
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:16,311
Then you don't need to do anything

1562
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:18,020
but continue to put out the content

1563
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,916
that you think will do that.

1564
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:20,749
- [CJ] Thank you.

1565
00:56:20,749 --> 00:56:21,999
- I think the reason I said like,

1566
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:22,968
we'll take care of that,

1567
00:56:22,968 --> 00:56:26,236
is what I don't want you to
do that so many people do,

1568
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:28,716
whether they're 13 or 81.

1569
00:56:28,716 --> 00:56:30,372
So many people get into the rat race

1570
00:56:30,372 --> 00:56:32,081
of how many followers they have.

1571
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:33,076
Right?

1572
00:56:33,076 --> 00:56:35,729
And like, that's just not
the game that you wanna play.

1573
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:37,233
You know what I mean?

1574
00:56:37,233 --> 00:56:40,200
Because, the reality is is that,

1575
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,421
that's gonna dictate too many actions.

1576
00:56:42,421 --> 00:56:45,469
You can't let your
self-esteem or self-worth

1577
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:47,800
be wrapped up into metrics on YouTube.

1578
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,566
Because it's one tiny proxy

1579
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:51,253
in the reality of what you're up to.

1580
00:56:51,253 --> 00:56:52,503
You understand?

1581
00:56:53,597 --> 00:56:54,493
- [CJ] Thank you.

1582
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:55,326
- You're welcome.

1583
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:58,326
(audience applauds)

1584
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:04,620
Yeah, we're gonna throw
a right hook right now.

1585
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,075
What's the name of your channel CJ?

1586
00:57:06,075 --> 00:57:07,025
- CJ Boling.

1587
00:57:07,025 --> 00:57:07,933
- [Gary] Spell it.

1588
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:10,127
C-J-B-O-L-I-N-G.

1589
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:10,960
- Slower, 'cause you want them

1590
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,334
to actually fuckin' follow you.

1591
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:14,564
(audience laughs)

1592
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:17,491
- C-J-B-O-L-I-N-G.

1593
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:19,349
- [Gary] B-O-L-I-N-G?

1594
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:21,177
It would really mean a whole lot to me,

1595
00:57:21,177 --> 00:57:24,169
if I've given you one inch
of value ever in my life

1596
00:57:24,169 --> 00:57:25,615
for you to follow this kid.

1597
00:57:25,615 --> 00:57:28,454
Let's see how many
followers he has on YouTube

1598
00:57:28,454 --> 00:57:29,718
by the end of this weekend.

1599
00:57:29,718 --> 00:57:30,639
- [Woman] Can he get a picture?

1600
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:31,689
- Yeah, get in here CJ.

1601
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:32,572
Come here.

1602
00:57:32,572 --> 00:57:35,572
(audience applauds)

1603
00:57:41,238 --> 00:57:42,071
Good luck brother.

1604
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:45,430
(audience applauds)

1605
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,871
Hey, I've only got a couple more minutes

1606
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:48,936
just trying to be fair
to the people in line.

1607
00:57:48,936 --> 00:57:50,182
I'm not sure if I'm gonna
be able to get to you,

1608
00:57:50,182 --> 00:57:51,646
but we'll see how long
they let me sit up here.

1609
00:57:51,646 --> 00:57:52,479
Go ahead my man.

1610
00:57:52,479 --> 00:57:53,312
- Hi Gary.

1611
00:57:53,312 --> 00:57:54,145
- Hey Devon.

1612
00:57:54,145 --> 00:57:57,046
- I'm one of the 99 or 100% of the people

1613
00:57:57,046 --> 00:58:01,046
that before today my wife
has been beating me up

1614
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:03,579
to listen to you just once.

1615
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:05,987
I kept--
- [Gary] Fighting it.

1616
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:06,907
- Yes, I kept fighting it.

1617
00:58:06,907 --> 00:58:08,365
- [Gary] You're like, fuck that guy.

1618
00:58:08,365 --> 00:58:10,044
I get it, I get it.

1619
00:58:10,044 --> 00:58:11,100
I know how you roll Devon.

1620
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,402
- And she tells me that
I think she's rude to me,

1621
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:16,496
I should wait until I meet you.

1622
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:17,896
That you're gonna beat it up for me.

1623
00:58:17,896 --> 00:58:21,820
I wanna ask you, I'm finally
drawn into what she's doing.

1624
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,980
I want to know what I need
to do to stay on focus,

1625
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,765
on track, and stay motivated,
you know, everyday.

1626
00:58:28,765 --> 00:58:30,031
- To me, generally?

1627
00:58:30,031 --> 00:58:32,282
- Yes she blogs about food.

1628
00:58:32,282 --> 00:58:35,316
She develops food recipes, and everything.

1629
00:58:35,316 --> 00:58:37,354
- But you're asking for
you, how you stay focused?

1630
00:58:37,354 --> 00:58:38,187
- Yes.

1631
00:58:39,399 --> 00:58:41,075
- Listen, some of you
have heard this from me.

1632
00:58:41,075 --> 00:58:43,947
This is such a big one for me.

1633
00:58:43,947 --> 00:58:45,964
I've said it in a funny setting,

1634
00:58:45,964 --> 00:58:47,491
and I've said it other times.

1635
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:51,658
I just really wish people
knew that they were gonna die.

1636
00:58:52,892 --> 00:58:55,499
Devon like, how can
you not stay motivated?

1637
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:57,444
Do you know that the odds
of becoming a human being

1638
00:58:57,444 --> 00:58:59,865
are 400 trillion to one?

1639
00:58:59,865 --> 00:59:01,109
- [Devon] No (laughs).

1640
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:04,978
- Well great, sit on
that shit for a minute.

1641
00:59:04,978 --> 00:59:09,069
Like, we are so unbelievably
lacking perspective

1642
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:12,429
and are so not grateful
for what's happening here.

1643
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:15,205
We so focus on negativity,

1644
00:59:15,205 --> 00:59:17,053
and shit that's bothering us.

1645
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,102
We need to spend way
more time on optimism,

1646
00:59:20,102 --> 00:59:22,980
and good, and all the good
things that are happening.

1647
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,046
That will motivate--

1648
00:59:24,046 --> 00:59:26,414
I am completely driven by gratitude.

1649
00:59:26,414 --> 00:59:29,454
Every true day that I don't
get a text or phone call

1650
00:59:29,454 --> 00:59:34,110
that somebody I love died,
or has terminal illness,

1651
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,693
I'm fuckin' pumped.

1652
00:59:36,731 --> 00:59:38,814
So, it's perspective Dev.

1653
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:43,599
Like, the fuck do you
have to complain about?

1654
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,190
- No I don't complain, I wanna make sure

1655
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,749
I'm moving from the
industry that I was in,

1656
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:48,599
into what she's doing,

1657
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:50,053
because she has become very successful.

1658
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,765
- It's regret man.

1659
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:53,600
You don't wanna be 80 sitting and saying,

1660
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,326
"Fuck I spoke to Gary, my
wife did it, this happened,

1661
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:57,589
"and I didn't do shit.

1662
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:58,599
"What the fuck?"

1663
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:02,203
Listen, I'm gonna give
you guys a huge, huge,

1664
01:00:02,203 --> 01:00:03,703
unbelievable hack.

1665
01:00:04,796 --> 01:00:08,963
One day, one hour, go and
volunteer in a nursing home.

1666
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:17,211
It is the great move that
everybody here can do.

1667
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:19,517
First of all, it's just nice to do that.

1668
01:00:19,517 --> 01:00:21,309
And you give back, and it's tremendous.

1669
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:23,907
And it's unbelievably impactful.

1670
01:00:23,907 --> 01:00:26,883
Number two, thank you, number two,

1671
01:00:26,883 --> 01:00:30,123
you will get way more, because
you're gonna see something

1672
01:00:30,123 --> 01:00:32,859
that you haven't seen
in such a pure state.

1673
01:00:32,859 --> 01:00:34,442
It's called regret.

1674
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:39,254
You will face regret in a
way that will fuck with you

1675
01:00:39,254 --> 01:00:43,265
so hard that you will
stay focused and on track

1676
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:45,679
for the rest of your fuckin' life.

1677
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:48,119
The number one thing that you will taste,

1678
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:49,953
if you go to a nursing home,

1679
01:00:49,953 --> 01:00:51,781
is you will find multiple people

1680
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,920
that will talk to you about regrets

1681
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,543
in a way that will pierce your soul.

1682
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:59,635
In a way that you've never felt before.

1683
01:00:59,635 --> 01:01:01,943
Because they're actually in that place

1684
01:01:01,943 --> 01:01:03,860
where time has run out.

1685
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,287
And it will make you go back home,

1686
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,391
and start cooking for the first time,

1687
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:10,919
starting a video, running.

1688
01:01:10,919 --> 01:01:12,874
Like you'll start doing shit,

1689
01:01:12,874 --> 01:01:15,208
that you've been pondering
for the last decade

1690
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,641
after one hour of giving back.

1691
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:19,768
Putting karma points in the bag,

1692
01:01:19,768 --> 01:01:22,563
and it will be hugely beneficial for you.

1693
01:01:22,563 --> 01:01:25,215
So please, please, please consider that.

1694
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,120
- [Devon] Thank you so very much.

1695
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:26,983
- You're welcome.

1696
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:27,873
(audience applauds)

1697
01:01:27,873 --> 01:01:31,166
- Alright Gary, regrets,
we don't wanna have 'em.

1698
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:34,083
We have two more days of VidSummit.

1699
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,144
Almost a full more day here.

1700
01:01:36,144 --> 01:01:37,577
I still gotta speak, so like,

1701
01:01:37,577 --> 01:01:39,247
you know I'll wrap up all
the big important stuff

1702
01:01:39,247 --> 01:01:40,438
after you're done.

1703
01:01:40,438 --> 01:01:44,724
But, what should these guys
be doing for the next 48 hours

1704
01:01:44,724 --> 01:01:46,251
so they don't have regrets?

1705
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:47,435
- That's a great question.

1706
01:01:47,435 --> 01:01:50,476
So, the reason I think
these things are good,

1707
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:53,549
have nothing to do with
the content of this stage.

1708
01:01:53,549 --> 01:01:55,364
This is the number one time

1709
01:01:55,364 --> 01:01:59,308
to start putting your
introvert self on the shelf,

1710
01:01:59,308 --> 01:02:02,581
to expand your ability to network.

1711
01:02:02,581 --> 01:02:06,440
This is 100% ROI successful for you

1712
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,919
if you legitimately go up to people

1713
01:02:07,919 --> 01:02:09,744
you've never seen before in your life,

1714
01:02:09,744 --> 01:02:13,118
say hello, and ask them
what they're about.

1715
01:02:13,118 --> 01:02:15,504
This is only about networking.

1716
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:17,268
Like, you should actually all leave,

1717
01:02:17,268 --> 01:02:19,149
and come to none of the
talks going forward.

1718
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:20,141
(audience laughs)

1719
01:02:20,141 --> 01:02:21,599
- Except for mine.

1720
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:26,080
- Including his, and
network the whole time.

1721
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,163
Guys, all the real magic is you know,

1722
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:32,918
with the best talk of the conference,

1723
01:02:32,918 --> 01:02:34,582
with the third best
talk of the conference.

1724
01:02:34,582 --> 01:02:36,398
(audience laughs)

1725
01:02:36,398 --> 01:02:40,044
All of that stuff, is
so stunningly secondary,

1726
01:02:40,044 --> 01:02:44,385
to you getting five to seven,
to 15 relationships here.

1727
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:45,770
And let me tell you something,

1728
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,353
karma is practical.

1729
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,370
I just said it in my last little thing,

1730
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,442
doing the right thing for CJ.

1731
01:02:52,442 --> 01:02:54,636
It's just super smart to do shit

1732
01:02:54,636 --> 01:02:57,875
that has no expectation in
return, or anything to do--

1733
01:02:57,875 --> 01:03:00,833
We're in a world where a lot
of thoughts of collaborations

1734
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,642
and things you do, you're thinking about

1735
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:05,426
what comes to you after you do.

1736
01:03:05,426 --> 01:03:07,954
Giving without expectation has been

1737
01:03:07,954 --> 01:03:11,209
one of the core pillars of my success.

1738
01:03:11,209 --> 01:03:13,921
You've lived it.
- [Man] Love it, there it is.

1739
01:03:13,921 --> 01:03:16,101
- Like it's a big fuckin' deal.

1740
01:03:16,101 --> 01:03:17,354
Please do it.

1741
01:03:17,354 --> 01:03:20,010
- I'm gonna share with you
guys one pro-tip I have.

1742
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:21,771
I go to a million of these conferences

1743
01:03:21,771 --> 01:03:23,275
and talk to so many people.

1744
01:03:23,275 --> 01:03:26,152
Networked until I became
friends with Gary,

1745
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:27,367
and this is how I did it.

1746
01:03:27,367 --> 01:03:28,518
When you go to a conference,

1747
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:29,850
you don't hang out with your friends,

1748
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,050
the people that live in
your state, anyone else.

1749
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,653
You talk to as many people
you've never met before,

1750
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:36,457
and here's the theme,
this is gonna be weird,

1751
01:03:36,457 --> 01:03:37,578
because I probably talked
to you guys yesterday

1752
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:39,361
and this exact same thing happened.

1753
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,713
Where it's like, "Hey, how are you?

1754
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:41,779
"What do you do? What's your jam?

1755
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:43,225
"Learn about you, that's so cool."

1756
01:03:43,225 --> 01:03:44,657
Like, get a good read on someone,

1757
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:46,763
become friends, follow
'em on Twitter, whatever,

1758
01:03:46,763 --> 01:03:48,588
and then it's, "Dang is
there food around here?

1759
01:03:48,588 --> 01:03:51,533
"I'm lookin' for food right now."

1760
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:53,157
Literally go around looking for food,

1761
01:03:53,157 --> 01:03:54,392
talking to people.

1762
01:03:54,392 --> 01:03:56,873
Five minute conversation, become friends.

1763
01:03:56,873 --> 01:03:58,176
Then go look for food.

1764
01:03:58,176 --> 01:04:00,596
"Oh I need to go get a
drink, where's Holiday at?"

1765
01:04:00,596 --> 01:04:02,025
And you go talk to someone else.

1766
01:04:02,025 --> 01:04:03,657
Get that five minute friendship in,

1767
01:04:03,657 --> 01:04:05,137
and then, "Oh man, so I've
been looking for food.

1768
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:06,314
"Is there food around?"

1769
01:04:06,314 --> 01:04:07,776
And then you walk off looking for food.

1770
01:04:07,776 --> 01:04:09,282
Then go get that next conversation.

1771
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:10,248
Like, everyone.

1772
01:04:10,248 --> 01:04:11,776
I want everyone to end
their conversation with,

1773
01:04:11,776 --> 01:04:12,968
"I'm looking for food."

1774
01:04:12,968 --> 01:04:14,400
Then go talk to someone new.

1775
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,070
Talk to everyone in this conference

1776
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:19,144
'cause VidSummit 2017 is lit.

1777
01:04:19,144 --> 01:04:20,217
I'm not gonna dab.

1778
01:04:20,217 --> 01:04:21,586
Alright, that's that guys.

1779
01:04:21,586 --> 01:04:24,741
Have a great lunch, go find
food, talk to everyone.

1780
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:25,574
- Thank you.

1781
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:28,574
(audience applauds)

1782
01:04:29,677 --> 01:04:31,092
- I don't know how this became my life,

1783
01:04:31,092 --> 01:04:33,954
but D-Rock just woke
me up on a text saying

1784
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:36,586
we need a question of
the day for the vlog so,

1785
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:37,618
A. Fuck me,

1786
01:04:37,618 --> 01:04:39,535
B. Question of the day.

1787
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,787
What are you trying to
be an influencer for?

1788
01:04:43,787 --> 01:04:48,512
Or what you trying to
accomplish with the attention

1789
01:04:48,512 --> 01:04:50,880
that you're trying to amount for yourself

1790
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,208
or your business?

1791
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,495
Answer me that.

1792
01:04:53,495 --> 00:00:00,000
