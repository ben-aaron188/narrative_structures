1
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:04,096
- What up blog?

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,652
We're back.

3
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:08,069
New York City, beautiful day.

4
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:12,171
Pretty intense 2.5 days to Asia.

5
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,519
I'm back on the playing field.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,259
Wonderful day.

7
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:18,092
- Wonderful day.

8
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:19,425
- Wonderful day.

9
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:22,787
Really productive, super excited

10
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:24,587
about what's going on there.

11
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:27,254
(indiscernible)

12
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:33,172
♫ We're unstoppable

13
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:34,592
- Hey guys.

14
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:37,474
This is going to be an incredible video.

15
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:42,060
I'm so fascinated by hiring
and building businesses,

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,856
this is one of the most
interesting exchanges I've ever had

17
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:46,069
in a conference.

18
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:47,649
I had this in Singapore.

19
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,554
It was incredible back and forth.

20
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:50,853
There was an insight that I

21
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:53,344
that I genuinely believe
will help so many.

22
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,764
Tens of thousands of you have

23
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,485
a better business going forward.

24
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:57,625
Hope you enjoy this.

25
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,456
Let me know what you think.

26
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:01,468
- [Audience Member] Every business there's

27
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:02,987
a supply and the demand side.

28
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:04,568
- The most interesting thing

29
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:06,632
that I've heard somebody
say in a long time,

30
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:08,349
because you're 100% right.

31
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:12,735
It blows my mind that almost
nobody talks about it.

32
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,742
- [Audience member] Here's my issue.

33
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,334
I don't have any problem
with the demand portion.

34
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:17,167
- Okay.

35
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:18,444
- [Audience member] The
minute I go out there,

36
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:21,556
I open my mouth, I'll get business.

37
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:23,260
- You don't know how to fill the pipe.

38
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,194
- Yes.

39
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:26,752
And I don't know how to duplicate myself.

40
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:28,214
- Because you can't.

41
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:29,473
I don't know if you've heard.

42
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:31,014
(audience laughing)

43
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:32,072
- [Audience member] Yes, I know that.

44
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:33,128
But I need to,

45
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:35,810
I really, really need
to automate my business

46
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,591
and duplicate myself so that I can go home

47
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:38,809
and have a holiday.

48
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:40,719
- I understand.

49
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,472
There's only two things holding you back.

50
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:45,623
Your inability to operate,

51
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:46,921
or your ego.

52
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:50,161
So we just have to dissect it
with a couple of questions.

53
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,578
What do you sell?

54
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,508
- [Audience member] I'm in consulting.

55
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:54,484
- Great.

56
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:56,908
Why haven't you hired
more people to consult?

57
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:57,838
- [Audience member] I have.

58
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:58,671
- Good.

59
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:59,504
- [Audience member] But
they're just not up to it.

60
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:01,308
They're not up to the level...

61
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:03,122
- Hold on, hold on.

62
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,664
Up to whose level?

63
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,448
Yours, or the clients'?

64
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:10,365
- The level that I set
as a basis to benchmark.

65
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:12,908
- Real quick.

66
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,817
Who's hiring these people?

67
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:19,725
- [Audience member] Me.

68
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:21,589
- Let's play this game together.

69
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:22,788
(audience laughing)

70
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:23,621
- [Audience member] Alright.

71
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,960
- What's about to happen is
you're about to get exposed

72
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,449
to yourself and then
you'll be able to win.

73
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,367
You're playing a very
fun game of you've got

74
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:33,867
a big fucking ego.

75
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,097
I mean it.

76
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:37,843
You've got to wrap your head around this.

77
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:39,469
You're hiring.

78
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,539
You've created an arbitrary benchmark

79
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,326
that nobody's hitting,

80
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:46,239
because you've put yourself on a pedestal

81
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,142
at the mercy and the detriment
of building a bigger business

82
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:54,309
because you want to self-fulfill
that you're so much better.

83
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,763
Play with me.

84
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:02,452
You can't, think about...

85
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:04,959
- [Audience member] I'm not
willing to lower my standards.

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:05,974
- So don't.

87
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:09,141
Don't scale then, be a one-woman shop.

88
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,403
- [Audience member] I
believe I can do more.

89
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:14,801
I believe we should duplicate this.

90
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,100
I've got the models.

91
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,888
I've got everything there.

92
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,377
I basically completed
everything that I do.

93
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:24,270
All you need to do is take the template,

94
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,123
follow the SOP,

95
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,177
and let's go out,

96
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:28,599
hit the market.

97
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,314
- How many employees have
you had at the height?

98
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:32,410
- [Audience member] 12.

99
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,548
- And how many do you have now?

100
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,579
- [Audience member] Two.

101
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,896
- And was it customers firing them?

102
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:39,817
- [Audience member] Me.

103
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:42,824
At one point early this year,

104
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:44,000
everyone left.

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,180
I'm fine with that.

106
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,561
- Why?

107
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,021
- [Audience member] Because
they realized that it was

108
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:49,600
the wrong place for them to be.

109
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,749
I realized that I can't,

110
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,897
there's no point for me to keep anyone

111
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:55,606
when they can't do the job.

112
00:03:55,606 --> 00:03:56,689
I'm prepared.

113
00:03:57,758 --> 00:04:00,351
- Have you thought about the possibility

114
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:04,518
of you being a great
consultant but a terrible boss?

115
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:07,173
I'm asking, I'm asking.

116
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:09,564
- [Audience member] I have
the reputation I know.

117
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:10,740
- Okay.

118
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,490
Thanks for answering.

119
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:16,418
I'm being serious with you.

120
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,096
The reason I went right
at it: I want you to win.

121
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,598
It's a game of ego.

122
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:24,291
What people don't understand
is that is the problem.

123
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,941
The reason that I've been
able to scale VaynerMedia,

124
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:28,564
many think that I have an ego.

125
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,309
I play on confidence,

126
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,745
which is what allows me to scale.

127
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:36,144
I don't hold everybody
to an arbitrary metric

128
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:37,561
that has no reality other

129
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:40,478
than what's playing in my own head.

130
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:44,768
To me, if you're the one firing,

131
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,456
or they're quitting 'cause

132
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:49,667
the work environment is exhausting

133
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,141
because you keep pounding the drum

134
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:56,306
of some fake Mendoza
line of quality needed

135
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:58,742
that you are the judge and jury of.

136
00:04:58,742 --> 00:05:01,381
It's some interpretation of how you decide

137
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,735
they follow the template.

138
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:05,805
You're just scratching your own ego

139
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,887
of how great you are at the
detriment of your business.

140
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:11,965
The reason I have 800
employees and high retention

141
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:14,639
is I don't hold any of them to my standard

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,344
because they don't need to be me

143
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:17,886
to build an actual business.

144
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:21,215
You decide if you want
to build a one-woman shop

145
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:23,048
or an actual business.

146
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,130
(audience clapping)

147
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:30,663
And can I tell you something?

148
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,057
There's nothing wrong
with a one-woman shop,

149
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:35,900
the way you scale is you
may charge for content,

150
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,791
you may write a book,

151
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,414
you may start getting paid more to speak.

152
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:39,790
You know what I mean?

153
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,379
Even when I say it,

154
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,477
you don't need to build a
40-person consulting shop

155
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:46,698
because maybe you don't like it.

156
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:48,241
It's not that you're a bad person,

157
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,431
it's that you don't want
to lower your standards.

158
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,947
If you're stuck in that,

159
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:57,444
then monetize a different way
by expanding more around you

160
00:05:57,444 --> 00:06:00,446
versus trying to build out
the actual business around it,

161
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:01,464
you know what I mean?

162
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:02,435
And that's okay.

163
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:03,855
It doesn't make you a bad person.

164
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:04,688
As a matter of fact,

165
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,577
you'll probably be
disproportionally more successful

166
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:08,117
'cause you're being self-aware

167
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,469
and enjoying being the one-person band

168
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,174
and making your money that way.

169
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:14,119
You don't have to build VaynerMedia.

170
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,597
You don't have to build Bain or McKinsey.

171
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:19,764
Be you and be your best
self your way and enjoy it.

172
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:25,085
(audience clapping)

173
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,760
Easily one of the best
videos for so many of you.

174
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,519
The question of the day
is: did this help you?

175
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,573
And more importantly,

176
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:33,232
what are you gonna do about it?

177
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:34,286
See ya.

178
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:35,342
♫ There's a moment

179
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:36,921
♫ In your bones when

180
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:39,960
♫ When the fire takes over

181
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,547
♫ Blood is running

182
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,168
