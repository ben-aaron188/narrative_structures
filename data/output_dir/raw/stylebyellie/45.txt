2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,350

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,010
watching all the kids play.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,658
- Patriots or Eagles? Yeahhhh

5
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:13,280
Please don't make fun of me if this is

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,450
like an obvious answer
and everyone knows it.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,800
Where you guys flying from?

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,704
- Kansas City all the way to New York.

9
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:21,537
- Good night.

10
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:22,370
I love you.

11
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,621
- I love.

12
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:25,630
- I love you too.

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,360
- Happy Super Bowl Sunday!

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,110
We are all out in the backyard

15
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,450
just having a good time.

16
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,980
These two pregnant sisters are being

17
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,000
pregnant together.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,437
- The weather is wonderful.

19
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:36,670
- It looks cold, but it's not.

20
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,510
- Yeah, it feels really nice outside.

21
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,880
We've got some new arrivals coming in on

22
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,650
the most recent landing, flight A113,

23
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,150
coming in hot from, where
you guys flying from?

24
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,109
- Kansas City all the way to New York.

25
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,440
- Kansas City to New York.

26
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,130
That's an odd stop to come into Utah,

27
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,350
and they're coming in,

28
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,180
experiencing some turbulence here,

29
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,540
so we ask that everyone keeps their

30
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,630
seatbelts fastened.

31
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,650
- Oh no, someone peed their pants,

32
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,769
they got too nervous.

33
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,860
- Oh no, we should probably get some

34
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,520
extra clothing from the carry-on.

35
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,330
- No, we're just out
here having a good time

36
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,830
before the game starts
it's about one o'clock and

37
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,920
the game starts at four
o'clock our time I think,

38
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,890
so we're waiting for
family and friends to come

39
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,210
to get ready to rock and roll,

40
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,130
and to eat some delicious snacks.

41
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,600
Penny is loving having
all of the kids outside.

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,410
It's finally warm enough that we're like

43
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,370
playing out here and having
a good time, ya know.

44
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,660
Hey Penny, come here, she is so exhausted.

45
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,640
We have been wearing
her out left and right,

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
that's a good girl Penny.

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,010
- K, I'm hoping Penny goes back, yup.

48
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,560
- She is just laying in the snow watching

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,790
all the kids play, haha, look at her face.

50
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,900
Penny, girl, haha, is that yummy?

51
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,020
That is awesome.

52
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,070
Good girl.

53
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,940
So you know how the other day I tried a

54
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,140
new curling iron on my hair,

55
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,600
well not a new curling
iron cause (inaudible)

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,118
but I got my curling iron back, that one.

57
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:11,718
Tight on the top, loose on the bottom.

58
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:14,073
- Here, let me demonstrate.

59
00:02:14,073 --> 00:02:15,770
- Julie's trying on her hair now.

60
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,410
I love it!

61
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,730
- It's fun to try new products,

62
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,090
especially at your sister's
house, so thank you.

63
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,240
- I know, you're welcome,
you look so cute.

64
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,020
We took a picture of
our bellies last night.

65
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,756
Look at that big belly

66
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:29,010
- (laughing) (inaudible)

67
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,217
- Mine doesn't look that big.

68
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,600
You're a little over a month ahead of me.

69
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,990
- Okay, please don't make fun of me

70
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,580
if this is like an obvious answer

71
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,480
and everyone knows it

72
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,658
- It's a steak knife.

73
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:42,290
- But, so you have avocados and then you

74
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,880
mash em up and everything, and then it

75
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,840
turns into guacamole.

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,010
It doesn't happen with potatoes.

77
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,170
You mash potatoes up,
they're mashed potatoes.

78
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,878
Why don't we call it mashed avocado?

79
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,010
- You call it guacamole
cause you add stuff to it.

80
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,088
- Do you though?

81
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:58,118
- Yeah, it's not just avocados, tomatoes

82
00:02:58,118 --> 00:02:59,115
- We add stuff to mashed potatoes.

83
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,360
- Yeah, exactly.

84
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,050
- Ya add some garlic and butter and gravy

85
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,520
to mashed potatoes.

86
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,470
- Yeah, but this you add like tomatoes

87
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,280
and red onions and it's haha!

88
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,403
- Knife, holy cow

89
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:10,236
- You put that knife down.

90
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:11,310
- So, but yeah, you could do all of that

91
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,510
with potatoes too.

92
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,536
- True.

93
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,380
- I think it's its origin, right, so like

94
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,300
avocados are more like they're,

95
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,850
I don't know, to me like potatoes

96
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,837
- Boring!

97
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:23,910
- Potatoes are like grown

98
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,421
- We're done (laughing)

99
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,254
- In Idaho

100
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:28,620
- Too long a clip, stupid,
goodbye, done, reh, reh.

101
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,410
- So you're saying
because Idaho potatoes are

102
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,380
like oh yeah, it's a Idaho thing, it has a

103
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,380
different origins kind
of and then avocados

104
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:43,600
are from stereotypically
a different location,

105
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,880
then that's why?

106
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,713
- Correct.

107
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:46,880
- Oh, okay.

108
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,960
- Please let us know if
there's any other reason.

109
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,386
- Hey Jared.

110
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:51,219
- Yeah.

111
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,681
- Do you wanna tell all the
kids to come up and eat.

112
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:55,848
(light-hearted music)

113
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,940
- The time is almost upon us.

114
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,330
We have about thirty minutes until

115
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,820
the Super Bowl starts and I was thinking

116
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,420
we were gonna be down to the wire, so

117
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,480
what I did.

118
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,070
We have our t.v. and
then we have a sound bar

119
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,420
right here, and we don't usually use this

120
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,450
because it kinda is just annoying and it

121
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,266
gets in the way of the
kids and all of that stuff

122
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,040
and we don't want it to be a mess.

123
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,010
But we've got this subwoofer.

124
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,870
We've got a surround sound speaker here,

125
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,350
and a surround sound speaker there.

126
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,360
So, and it took me about a half an hour

127
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,190
to get it set up the way it should be,

128
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,690
like Vizio I love you guys,

129
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,340
like you make some really great stuff.

130
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,860
But it's a little too
complicated sometimes.

131
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,640
But we got the surround sound system going

132
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,570
so hopefully we'll have
some awesome football

133
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,320
experiences so we can listen to those

134
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,870
commercials and Justin
Timberlake perfectly, ya know?

135
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,932
Joe just gave me the
approval, he's like oh yeah.

136
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:49,212
- And the visual cause last year

137
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:50,280
was really good too.

138
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,467
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah his last show,

139
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,520
his last Super Bowl,

140
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,970
how many years has it
been since that incident.

141
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,430
- I don't know, but I do know this,

142
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,257
Bonnie and I missed it because

143
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,590
we were making out.

144
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,380
- That's the best kind of miss.

145
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,540
K we've got some chips,
we're bringing snacks down,

146
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,160

00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,924

161
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,530
- Well ya gotta through out

- Yeahhhh. Patriots or Eagles?

183
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:11,973
- Patriots.

184
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,477
- Yeahhh, Patriots or Eagles?

185
00:06:13,477 --> 00:06:14,310
- Patriots.

186
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,320
- Yeahhh. Here are my thoughts.

187
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,410
I would love to see the Patriots win,

188
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,010
but all in all I want to see a great

189
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,100
football game, a high scoring game on

190
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,850
both sides of the field where it's just a

191
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,530
fun game to watch.

192
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,650
That's what I want, I don't care who wins,

193
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,020
but it would be cool
to see Tom Brady like,

194
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,300
cement his legacy, you know what I mean,

195
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,230
like that would be cool.

196
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,580
- That's the one reason I'm rooting

197
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,630
for the Patriots, I wanna
see him break records.

198
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,575
- Right.

199
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:40,408
- Is this his last game?

200
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:41,241
- I don't think so,

201
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:43,020
I think he might play after this.

202
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,360
But, if he won tonight,

203
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,780
I wouldn't put it past him to retire.

204
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,420
By retiring with records
broken, I'll do that.

205
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,016
- Jackson, your turn.

206
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,383
- I'm gonna get that.

207
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:57,383
- that close, that close cheesecake.

208
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,184
(music)

209
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:09,249
- Ohhh, ho, ho, ho!

210
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,856
Calvin Say hi

211
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:12,750
- Hi

212
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,583
- You want some food?

213
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,477
- Say hi.

214
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:15,310
- Hi.

215
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,500
(music)

216
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,690
- Half time show, we
turned it down a hair,

217
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,140
so all these guys can play H...

218
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,790
- Two million people are playing.

219
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,870
- HQ, thanks Jackson.

220
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,562
Are you ready? Hold my
hand, I'll walk you to bed.

221
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:35,930
- Not ready.

222
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,610
- I remember growing up and when,

223
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,920
oh, wait just a minute, Calvin's asleep,

224
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,080
come here, I remember
growing up and cousins

225
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,880
would be here and it would be time for bed

226
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,700
and I would hate it, and I've warned you

227
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,670
quite a bit tonight
that bedtime was getting

228
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,400
ready, huh?

229
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,740
And you've been so good today, but it's so

230
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,447
hard to go to bed when
you know people are here.

231
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:00,100
But we're getting ready for bed and all of

232
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,580
our cousins are gonna get
ready to go home, okay?

233
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,695
Did you have a good day with everybody?

234
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:08,140
- Yes, but I want them
to have a sleepover,

235
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,257
all of them.

236
00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:11,780
- I know, we'll see, Cooper might, okay?

237
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:16,480
Okay, let's be quiet, go to bed.

238
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,135
(soft music)

239
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:19,951
go lay down,

240
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:21,886
no we can't turn on the light.

241
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:26,610
Okay, I love you so much.

242
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,590
Please be good, stay in bed okay?

243
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,800
Say okay, you're not gonna stay in bed?

244
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,492
- Good night

245
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:35,623
- I love you.

246
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,120
- I love...

247
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,990
- I love you too.

248
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,100
- Well frankly, I'm not
sure who's more embarrassed

249
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,700
that we lost on the
third question of HQ or

250
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,760
Tom Brady dropped that
easily catch, ya know,

251
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,220
for he coulda got a touchdown on that one.

252
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,300
Half time is over, Justin Timberlake

253
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,640
did pretty great.

254
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,107
You guys having fun
watching the Super Bowl?

255
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:55,940
Are everyone's tummy's full?

256
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,556
- Happy the kids are in bed.

257
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,691
- I'm trying to refuel Jared, refueling.

258
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:04,690
- Refuel, energize, Mom
knows where it's at, yes!

259
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,010
- Kids to bed and bring
out the good stuff.

260
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,350
- Jackson and Calvin are
in bed asleep right now,

261
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,420
this is amazing.

262
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,920
Well I hope you remember
about who everyone

263
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,130
voted for for the Super
Bowl because the Eagles

264
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,600
are the Champions, but
now the real winners

265
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,780
of the Super Bowl are
us because we all get

266
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,710
to watch "This Is Us".

267
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,220
- Lana just popped all of our necks.

268
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,160
Like my chiropractor
appointment's tomorrow

269
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,050
and I've been getting a
headache today and I felt

270
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,590
like instantly, it's amazing (laughter)

271
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,406
- I should probably learn how to do that.

272
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:39,660
- You should, I love
going to the chiropractor

273
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,910
so my appointment's tomorrow.

274
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,120
- Nice, well we got through it.

275
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,030
We made it through guys, congratulations.

276
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,120
You made it through the
episode of "This Is Us".

277
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,400
Hey, I'm talking

278
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,480
- That was a wonderful episode.

279
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,320
- It was a heartbreaking, it was good.

280
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,320
It was like, uh, ya know, Jack.

281
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,680
- Well it's like that
season has like taken

282
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,750
names, it was all over
the news about like now

283
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,070
they're talking about like house fires and

284
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,720
kitchen fires because of the season,

285
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,371
people are loving, loving "This Is Us".

286
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,300
- Yeah, if you haven't seen
"This Is Us" it's great.

287
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,930
It's also great because,
I don't know, the actor

288
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,150
who plays Jack liked my Tweet.

289
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,175
- Milo

290
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:26,060
- Milo, I can't pronounce his last name.

291
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,960
- All the actors are awesome, awesome,

292
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:30,112
I love them.

293
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:31,820
- Yeah, they have all done so good and

294
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,950
we're done for the night.

295
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,530
Like, we've had a blast.

296
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,970
The kids had a blast.

297
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,850
Our tummy's are so
stinking full from snacks.

298
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,683
At least mine are.

299
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,897
Your belly's are full with babies.

300
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:42,730
- Our belly's are full.

301
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,563
- And snacks.

302
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:44,811
- And snacks (laughing)

303
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,644
Thanks so much for watching guys.

304
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,580
Hope you have a wonderful day.

305
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,320
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up

306
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,000
and we will see you tomorrow.

307

Bye!
