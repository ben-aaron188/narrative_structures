1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,537
- The sun is out, and it feels so good.

2
00:00:02,537 --> 00:00:05,120
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,120
- First time on the chairlift.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,217
- [Kendra] Ready to go home?

5
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:15,050
- Yeah.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,720
- [Jeremy] So Janae
has been signing shoes.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,000
It's been so fun to know

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,140
that she understands what that means.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,100
I don't know if those will
go well with her jamas.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,200
But look, she's like, "Put it on!"

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,740
oh, it's slippery over there.

12
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:38,465
(children cheer)

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,870
Shoes, shoes.

14
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:47,723
♪ (mumbles) ♪

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,550
- We're running late to
gymnastics, but I don't care

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,351
because the sun is out,
and it feels so good.

17
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:59,934
(upbeat music)

18
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:06,320
The kids are doing an obstacle
course at gymnastics today.

19
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,900
- So one of the most important chores

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,080
that we've included for
our kids is decluttering.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,310
We bring everything from
all of the countertops

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,450
and all of the ledges that is clutter.

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,565
We put it all on the table,

24
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:31,730
and then we work together
to put it all away.

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,680
It's amazing how clutter can
just accumulate and accumulate

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,820
if it's not dealt with.

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,276
Can you go put the hammer up, bud?

28
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:38,109
- [Caleb] Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,942
- [Jeremy] Thanks.

30
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,730
- We're going skiing.

31
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,210
- [Jeremy] You're getting
all the snow stuff ready?

32
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,250
- [Elise] This one's mine.

33
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,083
- [Jeremy] Awesome.

34
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,150
Alright, and you got yours.

35
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,230
- Mm-hmm.

36
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,813
(upbeat music)

37
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,143
I don't see how we'll be skiing here.

38
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,105
Like I don't see much snow.

39
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:04,772
- I'm surprised too.

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,180
- [Jeremy] So Isaac, how are you feeling

41
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,260
about going skiing for the first time?

42
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,020
- I'm feeling excited and a little scared.

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,070
- [Jeremy] What are you
feeling scared about?

44
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,810
- Just since it's my first time.

45
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,536
- I'm feeling a little bit
scared and a little bit excited.

46
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:30,119
(upbeat music)

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,610
- It's really weird to walk

48
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,740
because it's like completely
flat on the bottom.

49
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,390
- It's just like tap dance shoes.

50
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:45,224
It's perfect.

51
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,590
- So we're starting off with the kids

52
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,890
doing a ski lesson to
learn how this works.

53
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,310
- Shoes!

54
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,760
This little girl likes shoes.

55
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:12,299
(upbeat music)

56
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,763
Success.

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,460
Not only is it sunny,

58
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,770
but the weather today is warm and amazing.

59
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,370
And it's just (sighs), it
makes a big difference.

60
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,330
I am so grateful for spring.

61
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,030
God knew that we couldn't
handle winter all year round,

62
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,890
so spring is a glorious thing.

63
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:35,601
(upbeat music)

64
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,670
So these kids have all grown so tall

65
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,490
that the swings that we hung
years ago are now too low.

66
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,890
(Kendra chuckles)

67
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,910
They still play on 'em,

68
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,348
but Jeremy and I need to
figure out how to raise these.

69
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:48,181
Hmm.

70
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:49,014
- [Laura] How do you raise 'em?

71
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:50,370
- [Kendra] We'll just
have to untie that knot

72
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,190
and tie a new knot that makes
it up a little bit higher.

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,350
- So the kids are trying
to use this rope lift

74
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,990
to get up the hill.

75
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,823
It's going!

76
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:06,882
- [Instructor] Stand up tall!

77
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:07,715
Stand up tall!

78
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:12,970
Yeah, just slowly grab.

79
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,120
Let go, let go, let go!

80
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,009
- [Kendra] Good job.

81
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,570
Good work, Ms. Laura.

82
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,810
- [Jeremy] There you go.

83
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:39,133
(Jeremy chuckles)

84
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,280
Good job, Elise.

85
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,730
You guys are skiing.

86
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,983
How was that?

87
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:46,483
- It's really fun.

88
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,140
- You're gonna just sit
down when it comes up, okay?

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,520
And lean back.

90
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,660
First time on the chairlift.

91
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,730
Elise is coming up.

92
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,490
The key is just don't go too early, okay?

93
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,830
So you wanna wait until we can stand up.

94
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,440
Not yet, not yet.

95
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,670
Don't go yet.

96
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,710
So you wanna start
standing up and push off.

97
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,600
Good job, Elise!

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,433
Awesome!

99
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,693
That was great, first time.

100
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,526
(whimsical music)

101
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,980
- Well, we're going on a bit of a walk,

102
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,670
and I've got Janae in the stroller.

103
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,270
Laura's walking with me, and
Caleb is riding his bike.

104
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,230
But I should have grabbed
the double stroller

105
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,900
because Laura wants to ride.

106
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,840
Then I'm holding her, and
then it's hard to push.

107
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,673
I'm holding my baby.

108
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:42,710
Are you ready to walk?

109
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,543
- Yeah.

110
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:52,375
- Oh!

111
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,700
She lost a ski.

112
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,957
Mastering the ski lift is
a big part of this journey.

113
00:05:58,957 --> 00:05:59,790
Have fun.

114
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,623
- [Instructor] What happened?

115
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:01,456
You lost a ski.

116
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:02,289
- [Elise] I don't know.

117
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,186
- [Jeremy] You got this, Elise.

118
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:07,519
- [Instructor] Alright, now.

119
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,352
Oh, no!

120
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:10,935
(upbeat music)

121
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,160
- [Jeremy] Well, the snow is super slushy.

122
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,220
That's good for learning.

123
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,600
It slows you down.

124
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,550
Good job, Elise.

125
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,480
You're under control.

126
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,470
That's great!

127
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,450
So what did you think of your ski lesson?

128
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,743
- It was really fun.

129
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:32,121
Now I know how to ski.

130
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,370
- [Jeremy] You really
started to control yourself.

131
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,310
I'm proud of you.

132
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,028
Snap it in.

133
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:38,111
There you go.

134
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:42,439
- It feels so good to relax.

135
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,150
I'm a bit afraid of heights.

136
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,390
- [Jeremy] Well, I'm proud
of you for doing this.

137
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,280
Hey, Isaac.

138
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:53,510
- Can we go up the top?

139
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,410
- You wanna go to the top of the hill?

140
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,397
You okay, buddy?

141
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:01,280
Are you alright?

142
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,113
So we came over.

143
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:03,070
We're going off the top of the hill,

144
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,800
and it was a lot steeper
than we were ready for.

145
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,750
Isaac crashed, but he
gave the big thumbs up.

146
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,505
So I'm glad he's enjoying it.

147
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:12,088
(upbeat music)

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
This is our last run.

149
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:30,741
So let me know on the poll

150
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,150
if you've ever skied
or snowboarded or both.

151
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,040
Let us know.

152
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,412
Do you wanna keep going?

153
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:41,245
- Yes.

154
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,838
- Okay, let's do one more.

155
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,216
It's just so fun.

156
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,799
(upbeat music)

157
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:55,250
- I wanna come do this on my birthday

158
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,760
even though my birthday is in the summer.

159
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,660
- I just don't think
there'll be any snow, buddy.

160
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,770
We'll have to go to the North Pole.

161
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,090
Well, I look forward to
the day when we're able

162
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,541
to take them out to the Rocky
Mountains and do some skiing.

163
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,124
(upbeat music)

164
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,988
♪ Who do you think you are ♪

165
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:21,387
♪ Dream about being a big star ♪

166
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:24,593
♪ Thunder, feel the thunder ♪

167
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:26,460
♪ Lightning and the thunder ♪

168
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,240
- We are running into the grocery store

169
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,930
with these little people.

170
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,450
We just need a couple of things,

171
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,760
one of which is ice cream because
we're having a family over

172
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,220
for dessert and a game night tonight.

173
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,539
And dessert is gonna be ice
cream so it's super easy.

174
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,000
- This is my favorite (mumbles).

175
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,550
I wanna try cinnamon roll.

176
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,370
- Caleb is a big fan of
oatmeal, so we're stocking up.

177
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,203
It's always hard for me

178
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:49,740
when I'm buying ice cream for a group

179
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,600
because everybody likes
different kinds of ice creams.

180
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,840
And I looK at it and
I'm like, "I don't know

181
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,720
"which kind everybody's
gonna like the best."

182
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,990
So what are your favorite
kinds of ice creams?

183
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,930
Or what do you think are
go-to crowd pleasers?

184
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,380
What do you get when you
need to get ice cream

185
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,310
that everybody likes?

186
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,202
What's that one?

187
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,680
- [Laura] I'm voting for it.

188
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,940
- [Kendra] You're voting for it?

189
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,887
How's it going?

190
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:07,720
- Good.

191
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,920
- We got more than we needed.

192
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,040
- We did get more than
I planned on getting.

193
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,190
Janae's enjoying looking at everything.

194
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,023
We did it!

195
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:15,400
I survived with the three kids.

196
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,490
I can't believe I used
to do this with four.

197
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,430
Five isn't harder for some reason

198
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,940
because the big kids are so helpful.

199
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,690
Thanks for your help, Caleb.

200
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,290
Oh, it's getting dark out there.

201
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,343
How are you?

202
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:28,176
- Good.

203
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,340
- [Kendra] Ready to go home?

204
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,350
- Yeah.

205
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,950
- So Jeremy and I have
people over on occasion,

206
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,190
but not super often.

207
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,780
And one of those reasons
that I've been nervous

208
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,010
about inviting new
people over to our house

209
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,355
is I think I'm a little
bit self conscious.

210
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:44,110
I'm self conscious that our house

211
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,630
is not maybe large enough to host people.

212
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,560
Like maybe there's not seats for everyone

213
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,410
or things like that.

214
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,880
And also, my house isn't decorated at all.

215
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,950
It's a very simple home.

216
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,697
It's a beautiful home, and we love it.

217
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,040
But I think when new
people are coming over,

218
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,980
it kinda makes me look at it

219
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,040
through different eyes and I'm like,

220
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,940
"Uh, I don't know if we should
really be hosting anybody.

221
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,365
So while we have, you know,
good friends over regularly,

222
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:12,310
it's always a little bit
intimidating to me to invite

223
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,636
new people over, especially
people that I don't know well.

224
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:17,912
And I really want to get to
know my neighbors better.

225
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:21,080
You know, these people we
have lived near for so long,

226
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,860
and you drive by and you
wave, maybe say hello

227
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,490
in the summertime when
people are out and about.

228
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,180
But I've thought many times
about inviting neighbors over

229
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,820
for dinner, but that just
feels intimidating to me.

230
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,880
So I decided that I want to change that.

231
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,780
And so Jeremy and I have
already started extending

232
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,160
some invitations, and I'm truly excited

233
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,930
to get to know the people
of our church community

234
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,990
and our neighborhood community
better simply by trying to be

235
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,330
more open and open the doors of our home.

236
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,050
And it doesn't have to be
this deluxe amazing dessert

237
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,230
or this phenomenal dinner.

238
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,470
And it can just be ice cream,
or it can just be pizza,

239
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,780
but it's just sitting down
together and visiting,

240
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,280
even if it's over paper plates.

241
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,020
That's a goal that Jeremy
and I are working on,

242
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,900
and I'm really looking forward to it.

243
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,704
- [Jeremy] So Kendra loves puzzles.

244
00:11:07,704 --> 00:11:08,600
- I do.

245
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,440
- [Jeremy] It's a fun thing.

246
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,350
- This one's a really cool one.

247
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,150
It's a bunch of flip-flops.

248
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,300
So we are chatting about their day skiing

249
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,270
and putting in a few pieces before bed.

250
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,410
- [Jeremy] The kids have been so cute

251
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,250
telling you their excitement about it.

252
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,870
- It's been awesome hearing about it.

253
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,310
- Well, I was really proud of
how courageous the kids were.

254
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,143
Good night.

255
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:25,976
J House out.

256
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,036
So Elise has a pretty loose tooth.

257
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:31,703
(Jeremy laughs)

258
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:35,740
(Kendra chuckles)

259
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,578
- [Caleb] I'm just doing my squats.

260
00:11:40,578 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
